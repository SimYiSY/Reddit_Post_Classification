,BreakUps,"Everyday I hear the statement, ""I would do anything to get my ex back"". If you run quick search on YT, you will find a sea of coaches and ""Dating experts"" that will talk about the top 10 things you should do to get an ex back! 

I am here to tell you the key to getting an ex back, but also getting over an ex. Trauma. I know this is a weird concept but hear me out. We all experience Trauma, at work, growing up and in relationships. Trauma teaches us three major things: 

- Perspective 
- Empathy 
- Consequences

Why  is this big deal? Well we are incredibly stubborn. There is a biological reason for this. Our ancestors had to live beyond the elements, there were times our tribes were attacked, where we had to rebuild from scratch. More than normally we would find others who shared our beliefs, our thought patterns, this is why we resonate with others who share our values. But what does Trauma do? It isolates us, it causes us depression, it causes us to over analyze, most importantly, it causes use to question. What could I have done different. 
Initially at the beginning of a breakup we obsess over the notion of getting a love one back, we give up our value systems in order to satisfy another. It may work in some cases (usually for Anxious or Fearful Avoidant types), but in others it will only reinforce our ex's resolve in leaving us. We will come off as weak and needy. 

Time offers a unique perspective to us, this pain, this trauma....it constant, it's an emotional response to a situation, we are internalizing the experience of a breakup into our daily routine. We can easily bypass the pain receptors through self improvement, (gym, self work, therapy, friends...etc), over time our brains will begin new pattern and belief structures based on our experience. We will in an essence, retell the story of ourselves, with new narratives and boundaries. ""I remember when X hurt me"",  ""I remember when I felt Y about X"". These patterns are important in evolving our way of thinking....why? 

Well because maturity above all else comes from personal experience. Parents know this narrative too well, we can bring our own experience in the form of stories, but if the child is not receptive, they will not listen to us. Same goes for adults, if I have an image of the perfect spouse, nothing will sway my belief.....unless I'm traumatized, unless I am forced to internalize an emotional response to this memory, to question my resolve....to change my belief structure. This is why Dumpees mature faster than a Dumper, they are forced to deal with these underlying emotions, the deep rooted insecurity (Assuming they don't monkey branch from one relationship to the next). Over time the dumpee will gain perspective, they will gain honest reflection of what they bring, their value. 

The dumper will supress emotions of loss initially. More than likely they are running on a high, they rejected the ex, they are the person of value. Until Trauma hits them.....whether in the form of: 

- A breakup 
- A death 
- Life Altering Event 

It is only then that the dumper will gain their perspective, it is only then that you will hear from your ex. More than likely, by the time the dumper does reach out it's too late. The Dumpee has gone through the stages of grief, they have fully experienced the trauma, they have in a sense, learned the lesson of the relationship.

Don’t ask them back when they showed you they stopped wanting you.

You’re responsible for your own emotions and how you deal with them shouldn’t involve them.

,BreakUps,"Dear E.H,

It’s been three years since we broke up. Three years since I dumped you abruptly and broke your heart because I was having doubts about our relationship that I failed to tell you about. On top of that, I was toxic and didn’t respect you throughout our relationship. We were both young and naive, and it was our first relationship, but that’s no excuse for me to cause you so much devastation.

Breaking up with you honestly felt like it was the right thing to do, like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders. I was ready to move on with my life. But months later, I suddenly felt immensely guilty and regretful. It was then when I finally realized that I lost you, that I gave you up instead of trying to work things out together. I thought getting back together would heal me and make everything right and okay again. I reached out to you, desperately; I crawled my way back to you, to say I was sorry and wrong, and that I wanted you back. You ignored me, and it felt like you were getting your revenge on me. And I deserved it.

Since then, I had to live with the fact that I hurt you so much over my own mistakes. I’ve experienced a lot of internal regret, guilt, pain, and suffering. Everything I’ve experienced the past three years has left a deep gash in my heart that’ll never completely heal and disappear. And while I wish I never had to experience it in the first place, the pain and suffering forced me to slowly, but surely, put me on the path to become a better person. I’ve learned from my mistakes, I’ve grown stronger, and I’ve learned to accept myself and focus on the people I truly love and the things I’m truly passionate about. I’m just so sorry that I had to hurt you to realize all of that.

It’s hard to remember the warm and happy memories of us anymore; all I can remember are the times when I’ve let you down, and the times when I’ve hurt you. I never received any closure, but that’s why I’m writing this letter that I’ll never send;

I’m finally ready to move on.

But if you’re somehow reading this, I’m so sorry for breaking your heart. I’m so sorry for not trying hard enough for us, and I regret dumping you the way I did. I’m so sorry for being toxic and never respecting you, for never treating you right. I’m so sorry for all the pain and suffering I inflicted. I don’t expect you to forgive me, but I want to thank you for once loving me. I hope wherever you are right now, you’re safe and well.

,BreakUps,"Few months ago my ex broke up with me and left me for his old crush he had feelings before he knew me. I was devastated, I did all the mistakes that dumped person can do from begging to breaking no contact. I cried every day, couldn't sleep and eat well. I thought I'll be like this forever, because every day was the same, It became routine for a while. But I was wrong. After breaking no contact on his birthday (really wasn't worth it at all) I decided to just go no contact forever. And that's when the healing process finally started. When I look back now, I'm thinking how low my selfworth had to be that I begged and cried over someone who choose someone else over me. Time really give you new perspective and you realize many things you ignored before. 

After time during no contact, I stopped crying every day, but instead I was angry every time I thought about him. 
Then I started reading posts on this subreddit about how to move on. And one of the things that was almost in every post was ""forgiving your ex"" First I thought, forgive him? He doesn't deserve my forgiveness at all, but then I realized that if this is the way or part of moving on, I should do that, or at least try it, for myself. 
So I tried. But I didn't know how. I was literally just sitting and keep saying in my head :l forgive you, I forgive you, 100x times, but guess what? It didn't work. 

I thought that I'm probably done with it, just no trying, just let it go.. And then somehow, I realized another thing. 
Even though he cheated on me, left me for someone else, betrayed me, lied to me, and used my like a distraction (he himself accepted it) even though he would probably keep lying to me, because he wouldn't break up with me if his new girlfriend wouldn't say ""yes"" to him, even though he literally broke my heart, I don't think he's a bad person. 

I was really angry, so much, that I tried to see only and only the bad things in him, but I couldn't, even if it was just all lies, this person made me feel good for long time, made me smile every day, and helped me. 
We forget during this anger phase, that our exes are just humans like we, and they make their decisions based on what they think it's good for them.

I didn't forgive him for what he did, for his actions, but I realized third thing. He wasn't bad person, but just weak. People who cheats, do rebound, use others to give them comfort, make them feel good about themselves, people who lies, don't face and deal with their emotions. They're weak. He didn't do it on purpose, he just thought it's good for him, emotional weakness it's just part of him. We are on the other side strong, we face our emotions, we don't run, we take our time to heal. 

And that's how I found out how to forgive him. I know my case is not like others, I can't say, that your ex is weak, but for all of you, whose ex was like mine, I found this solution how to forgive him. And I believe and wish you all, that you'll find your own way how to forgive your ex. 
I can only say, that it really helped. And forgiving it's important. Thanks that, I no longer feel anger towards him, I do feel sad sometime, but I believe that will go away soon as well.

I was devastated, I did all the mistakes that dumped person can do from begging to breaking no contact. I cried every day, couldn&amp;#39;t sleep and eat well. I thought I&amp;#39;ll be like this forever, because every day was the same, It became routine for a while. But I was wrong. After breaking no contact on his birthday (really wasn&amp;#39;t worth it at all) I decided to just go no contact forever. And that&amp;#39;s when the healing process finally started. When I look back now, I&amp;#39;m thinking how low my selfworth had to be that I begged and cried over someone who choose someone else over me. Time really give you new perspective and you realize many things you ignored before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After time during no contact, I stopped crying every day, but instead I was angry every time I thought about him. 
Then I started reading posts on this subreddit about how to move on. And one of the things that was almost in every post was &amp;quot;forgiving your ex&amp;quot; First I thought, forgive him? He doesn&amp;#39;t deserve my forgiveness at all, but then I realized that if this is the way or part of moving on, I should do that, or at least try it, for myself. 
So I tried. But I didn&amp;#39;t know how. I was literally just sitting and keep saying in my head :l forgive you, I forgive you, 100x times, but guess what? It didn&amp;#39;t work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought that I&amp;#39;m probably done with it, just no trying, just let it go.. And then somehow, I realized another thing. 
Even though he cheated on me, left me for someone else, betrayed me, lied to me, and used my like a distraction (he himself accepted it) even though he would probably keep lying to me, because he wouldn&amp;#39;t break up with me if his new girlfriend wouldn&amp;#39;t say &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; to him, even though he literally broke my heart, I don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;s a bad person. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was really angry, so much, that I tried to see only and only the bad things in him, but I couldn&amp;#39;t, even if it was just all lies, this person made me feel good for long time, made me smile every day, and helped me. 
We forget during this anger phase, that our exes are just humans like we, and they make their decisions based on what they think it&amp;#39;s good for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t forgive him for what he did, for his actions, but I realized third thing. He wasn&amp;#39;t bad person, but just weak.

We are on the other side strong, we face our emotions, we don&amp;#39;t run, we take our time to heal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s how I found out how to forgive him. I know my case is not like others, I can&amp;#39;t say, that your ex is weak, but for all of you, whose ex was like mine, I found this solution how to forgive him.

,BreakUps,"Can’t believe it’s been 3 months. Just want to post my progress here because I feel like here is the only place that it can get a little appreciation. It’s a gonna be a bit of a long post so I hope you have the time to read it.

Compared to how i felt the first 2 months, I definitely feel better. I still can’t say I’m over her but I definitely realized a lot of things. No matter how much I wanted to get a closure from her, I should be able to give it to myself. I need to focus on making myself better. Tried to reflect on what went wrong and I realized that I shouldn’t focus on what I lacked but remember that a relationship requires a collective effort from both parties. It didn’t work out because she didn’t want to put the effort anymore and I realized that when she said that there’s nothing to work out for when she broke up with me. As I slowly detach, I also realized that I have overlooked red flags because i loved her so much. 

As for the question, “do I want her back?”. I don’t think I could answer that yet. As of now, I’m trying to become a better person. That’s my focus. If she happens to reach out and ask to get back together in the future, I would definitely have to consider a lot of factors. However, If by that time I realized that I’m better off without her, I’ll politely wish her well.

Just to share, here are things I’ve done during the 3 months that i think you can learn from:

- If you guys are still connected. Don’t check up on her or her friend’s social media.
———&gt; She’s the one who unfollowed me and removed me from her followers list. Don’t react to it.
———&gt; You don’t want to see any posts or updates about her that can bring you back to zero. What I did is whenever i get the urge to stalk her, I would just go to this sub instead.

- Do not reach out if you’re the dumpee
———&gt; I reached out to her twice after the break up; first time was one day after the break up, she told me that there’s nothing to talk about and told me to not reach out anymore. Second time, i sent an apology text and she never responded.
———&gt; If you just want to know the real reason why they dumped you, you won’t just get it by begging or asking. They broke up with you because they made up their mind to move on with their life with you

- Try to avoid places and things that would remind you of them. Go to new places and do something new instead
———&gt; I quit my job because that place itself reminds me of our love story. It was a hard decision but I have to do it so that I can heal faster. *Im not saying to quit your job too but If you think you need some time to be away from a place that would remind you of her, I would suggest to take a break from it. Also, I got a better job right after quitting so i think it’s a blessing in disguise.*
———&gt; Drive somewhere you never been before or you’ve been wanting to check out

- No matter how much you’re hurt do not talk bad about them
———&gt; Before quitting my last job, we work together. I would hear from our mutual friends that she would talk bad about me at work. I admit, it hurts and gets me mad but remember they’re only trying to make themselves feel better for dumping you. You don’t have to lower yourself to get back at them, you’re better than that! Continue on being yourself, because you’re awesome!

- Take your time healing
———-&gt; Do not hold yourself from crying. Letting your emotions out is the best way to deal with it. There would be a time that I would just cry because I’m overwhelmed with sadness and it’s okay. And yes, it’s okay for guys to bawl

- Have a support company
———-&gt; It’s good to have them but It’s also good to know how to make yourself feel better without relying on anybody. Sometimes your close friends wouldn’t be available when you need them so do your best to make your own self happy

- Do not go on a date unless you’re completely over them
———-&gt; I went on a date with someone I met on instagram and I could say that I wasn’t emotionally present when I went to the date. In the end, I had to apologize to the person I went out with and she understood but I’m pretty sure she was disappointed. THIS IS A HUGE MISTAKE FOR ME. PLEASE LEARN FROM ME

Been broken up with a lot times but this was the baddest break up I’ve ever been in. I don’t know how long it would take me to completely feel fine but I know I just need to keep working on myself.

7 months ago my ex left me and I managed to get away from the god awful stuff he was subjecting me to, I felt like my world was ending. I didn't want to breathe without him and I didn't think I would ever move on from it all, the progress was too slow and I didn't fully start to heal until I went no contact. No contact was extremely difficult for the first week but honest I wish I did it sooner, I didn't know what he was doing who he was with and tbh after a while I stopped caring and the hurt turned into hate. I couldn't hold onto that hate though because it would have consumed me, instead I worked on loving myself and bettering my own life and circumstances. 

When we broke up I moved into my parents tiny box room and arrived with nothing but my car and the clothes on my back, I had nothing, I still had my job but that was in the town I had lived in with my ex and if it hadn't have been for coronavirus closing my office and forcing me to work from home I may not have been able to afford to continue to work. 
During this time I did a lot of reflecting and I would be a liar if I said I was an angel throughout the relationship, I am diagnosed Bipolar type 2 and being in a relationship with me can be stormy?? If that's the correct word for it, a lot of my treatments were still trial and error because it's still a recent diagnosis but I was difficult to be with. That does not mean that absconds him of any responsibility for what he did to me and what he put me through but it can't have been easy for him either. He cheated on me, abused me in all ways you could think of and was a typical narcissist. 

My meds are currently working a treat, I've worked on myself and have fallen in love with someone I have known since I was 12 years old who was there the whole time, I just didn't know he would be the one. He is patient, caring, understanding of my condition, doesn't take any kind of bulls**t I give him and puts me in my place when I'm being a pain in the ass. He is amazing. He's never made me walk on eggshells and wants the same things in life that I do, whereas my ex didn't. I was stupid enough to think that I would change his mind on children and marriage. He was never going to change his mind, after age 25 the frontal lobe is fully formed and he was never going to change. 

I have bought my own flat and have it beautifully decorated which did cost a bomb and I absolutely love living alone. My boyfriend comes over most nights during the week but when I am alone, I don't mind my own company. 

I start my new job in 2 weeks time in a job that is going to pay me more than £4k more than what I am currently earning with my current employer, I am very excited with it. 

My relationship with my family and other friends have been fully restored and I am now very close to my parents who I was so isolated from earlier this year.

I will not sit here and say it's been easy, I would be a fool to believe it's been easy but the light at the end of the tunnel is there, it maybe 3 years from now or 3 months there's no timeline for healing but it is possible and you can do it.

,BreakUps,"I recently broke up with my boyfriend of 1 year and 3 months, and am seeking advice with how to handle my emotions, lack of closure, etc.

\-------------------------------------------------------

For context, I posted a bikini pic with showed cleavage (just a hot girl summer beach pic, nothing super scandalous), and he said he was really uncomfortable to the point where he didn't want to be with me anymore -  and I quote - "" Holy shit you've really changed. You're really not the person I fell in love with anymore.""  After that, he said:

""why do you try to defend yourself to believe its appropriate.. you're trying to go against society by posting this? What's the purpose? You've actually drastically changed and it actually really hurts cause I'm straying further and further away from you, to the point where it's actually reaching the point of just thinking about you now makes me want to cry""  

and proceeded to say ""I'm breaking up w you"" ""Goodbye X.""  and blocked me from all social media.

\------------------------------------------

My initial reaction was disbelief that he'd think this way 'going against society' and then I was PISSED. I felt that this event, along with other previous red flags, had cumulated into a major disappointment.  I also felt that he was very immature, mentally and emotionally, as we didn't even have closure - for me, being in a relationship means a two-way street - not doing whatever you want, whenever you want.  I'm starting to realize what I don't want in my future relationships - someone who isn't open to growth or change in a relationship, or is insecure and projects their insecurities on the s/o.

in fall of last year, our relationship was beyond unhealthy: we're talking co-dependency, emotional manipulation, him not understanding individualism in a relationship, or emotional boundaries, or the concept of having alone time, projecting his emotions and insecurities on me - this is all due to his baggage from previous relationships (that he dumped on me).  I told myself he'd learn, I'd teach him, and he'd come out a better person.  The result of this is the aforementioned context, and I definitely feel that I have some unspoken words for him and a lack of closure as well.

So I'm asking yall: what are some words of advice? I haven't cried yet because in my head i'm thinking he's not worth it and i'm good at compartmentalizing  - but also recognize it'll be unhealthy in the long run.  I have recognized that I am appreciative of the happy memories made, and that I've grown throughout this relationship, and that I'll embrace this period of time I've spent wholeheartedly.

How do I move forward? When do I know I've completely moved on? How do I remain on friendly terms with him (lol he blocked me on everything but I could send an email 5 yrs from now)? And lastly, how do I differentiate from a 're-bound' vs. moving on with someone i may be more compatible with?

,BreakUps,"This will be a long one

My ex and I got together when I was 14 (him 16) and have known each other since I was 11. I honestly think I loved him from the day I first met him - I remember at 11 I was 'dating' someone from my school for over a year (obviously not a serious relationship, just a primary school thing where you held hands and played games together after school), but I remember I ended things with this person at school because I had such a huge crush on this person (my now ex).

We were together 9.5 years total and of course he was my first love and we grew up together. I wasn't exactly his first love, he had a girlfriend prior to me for ~9 months. It ended up being a very toxic manipulative relationship for him but resulted in him cheating on me with her for the first month of our relationship. He told me about it, cried his eyes out at how sorry he was and how much he was struggling with the things she was saying to him (she said things like ""if you EVER loved me then you'd sleep with me"" etc.) - but he begged me for a second chance and blocked her on everything. He really never spoke to her again after that. I was young and forgave him, but it took a long time for me to fully trust him. But he worked tirelessly for years to prove to me that he would never hurt me like that again and worked to build/re-build our trust.

But over the entirety of our relationship I can honestly say he's been the kindest, sweetest most caring guy I can imagine. He was there for me through every single thing, every huge moment, every life decision. And he showed me nothing but the utmost support and love. But over almost 10 years its not always 100% smooth sailing - we had fights, we both made mistakes and said mean things to each other, but we always got through it and came back stronger than ever. We got together so young, and so the entire time we were learning not only how to be in a relationship, but how to even be adults. And with getting together so young, our lives completely melded into each others - really we didn't have much of a clue who we were on our own because we had never been on our own. Cue codependency.

As soon as I finished high school at 17 I moved in with him and his family and we lived together ever since (over 6 years). Its worth noting that I had a rough childhood - moving from foster home to foster home, eventually ended up living back with my dad but there were a lot of issues there too. But as a result I have depression/anxiety and have been on and off medication pretty much since I was 13.

I loved this man with all my heart, he was literally my everything and my one goal in life was always to have a happy life and family with him. We used to say that together we would build the family that I never had and always wanted, give our future children the childhood that I never had.

Fast forward to 2019 where things start going downhill. Its the year of our 9 year anniversary, and in late 2018 he had proposed to me - we were engaged. But outside of that I had also started again on antidepressants in the second half of 2018 - I had had a rough period and my partner was more supportive than ever, and once starting medication things had begun looking up and I was starting to feel good again.

In 2019 I was doing great at work, I'd recently been promoted, and was being considered for another promotion in a different department - I'd be under a new manager. I've always been a high achiever (A+ student, scholarships etc.) and so my drive to do well at work was no different. I ended up getting the promotion by mid 2019 and threw myself into work harder than ever - I had to impress this new manager more than anything else. This was really the beginning of the end.

For a little bit more backstory, I have 'daddy issues' - not in a joking way but legitimately. My dad was very harsh and awful and I spent every waking moment trying to impress him to no avail. I realise now how those tendencies played a part here.

In this new role I was working a lot of over time and travelling a lot. My manager was working overtime so I had to too right? To prove I was dedicated and a hard worker. Eventually messages with my manager about work (out of hours) turned into casual conversations. All travelling was done with my manager as well - so there were many long conversations throughout flights. Perhaps this isn't inherently bad - but looking back I feel even a lot of this was crossing lines.

But he would soon invite me to go to industry events, just the two of us (we were the only two people in this particular department at this office). I had to advance my career and do everything I could to learn right? So I'd accept. My manager was taking a huge interest in me, so I must be doing a good job! He was something of a mentor to me, teaching me constantly and encouraging me to keep improving myself - I thought everything was fantastic. 

My manager is 14 years my senior, married with 2 kids. Whilst travelling we would often have dinner together, accompanied by alcohol and some conversations were far past the 'professional' line. He opened up about problems he was having relationship-wise and I made the mistake of doing the same.

I guess I thought we were friends, or we had some sort of 'connection'. In some ways I was enamoured by the fact that someone of this calibre was actually interested in ME. I was young and vulnerable and fell for it all. He made a move on one of our trips and I didn't stop it. And in one fell swoop I became the one thing that I despised so vehemently - a cheater.

I was questioning everything - maybe my partner isn't right for me otherwise I wouldn't have done that? Maybe we've outgrown each other and I need more? Have I fallen out of love? And I made the decision to leave him within the month, that was September/October of 2019.

My life was a mess, I was moving out alone with strangers in a sharehouse, things with my manager continued with reassurances from him that we loved each other and I did the right thing - he also left his wife and essentially broke up his family. If he did all that then he MUST love me. I'm ashamed to admit that I had waited a couple of months into the breakup before I even told him about the cheating. I had thought that I'd already broken his heart enough and I didn't need to do any more damage.

And above all, I always had this crushing guilt that consumed me. My ex continued chasing me for months - even after I told him the truth of what happened. He never stopped loving me and just wanted more than anything to work through it together. I was in limbo, of missing him so desperately but thinking this thing with my manager was 'real'. That was until around May of this year. 

I had been slowly weaning of my antidepressants due to awful side effects and finally fully came off them in May. And my god the shift was instant. Within a week I felt this entire fog had lifted. What had I done? Why did I act like that? How was I so careless? I thought I had felt pain before this, but this was something else. The weight of everything I had done hit me like a tonne of bricks.

I can't describe it very well, but I was actually FEELING something for the first time in a long time. I realised how much the antidepressants had muted my emotions. Okay, I wasn't sad - but I wasn't happy either. I just felt nothing, I was numb. And I had no idea how much that was the case until I came off them.

Suffice to say I very quickly ended whatever the heck was happening with my manager. I cannot begin to describe how much I regret my actions, how much I wish with all that I am that I could rewind time. My ex had already began moving on at that point and after how long he spent begging for a second chance - it was 100% over for good. He's now in a relationship and has been for the past few months. He's happy and completely in love again.

And after everything that I put him through - he deserves that so much.

I've spent the last few months reflecting and working on myself (with the help of a therapist) and can truthfully say with all of my heart that I never ever want to cause pain like that to another soul again. I am so incredibly shocked and appalled at everything I did. And truthfully I deserve all of the pain and heartbreak that I am experiencing. But one thing I know is that I will never be the cause of suffering like that again. I learnt that in the hardest way possible.

I love my ex with all of my heart, and truth be told I won't be getting over him anytime soon. But I'm happy he's happy and no longer in the pain that I caused. 

I'm a heartbroken mess, he was my person - and I cannot believe I threw that away for anything. He was my best friend, my lover and everything in between.

,BreakUps,"He likes hummingbirds a lot. Basically all birds except for grackles, who are the assholes of the bird world. He will squeal and say they are cute. Cherish this. It is rare. 

He loves to take photos, and when he’s taking photos that seem like they don’t have anything in them, it’s because he wants to remember this exact moment. It will bring him joy later. 

He swears he isn’t ticklish but he is. Stay away from the part of his leg that connects to his hip unless you want to embarrass him. 

Make him feel safe. If he is trembling he is probably scared or cold and it is your job to make him feel warm, to make him feel assured and safe. If you can do that, what comes next will be the most beautiful thing. 

His parents are alcoholics. Don’t pressure him to drink. Just don’t. He won’t. 

Kiss him on the forehead if he is stressed. 

Caress the back of his neck when he gets a stress headache that won’t stop. 

He tends to overdo it on the salt and not enough on the water after exercise. Don’t take “all liquids are the same” for an answer unless you want him to piss blood. 

He loves to dance, he is just bad at it and it’s cute. 

He doesn’t care if the food is perfect, he is moved just because you tried. 

Men like to be surprised too. Put in some effort. 

He loves his friends more than some people love their parents. If you love him, love them too. 

His parents are great folks. They are bad parents but they are nice people. 

If you put your arms around him while you are both sleeping you will feel safer than you have ever felt. 

If you rest your head on his chest, you will know true calm.

Basically all birds except for grackles, who are the assholes of the bird world. He will squeal and say they are cute. Cherish this. It is rare. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He loves to take photos, and when he’s taking photos that seem like they don’t have anything in them, it’s because he wants to remember this exact moment. It will bring him joy later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He swears he isn’t ticklish but he is. Stay away from the part of his leg that connects to his hip unless you want to embarrass him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make him feel safe. If he is trembling he is probably scared or cold and it is your job to make him feel warm, to make him feel assured and safe. If you can do that, what comes next will be the most beautiful thing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His parents are alcoholics. Don’t pressure him to drink. Just don’t. He won’t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiss him on the forehead if he is stressed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caress the back of his neck when he gets a stress headache that won’t stop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He tends to overdo it on the salt and not enough on the water after exercise. Don’t take “all liquids are the same” for an answer unless you want him to piss blood. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He loves to dance, he is just bad at it and it’s cute. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He doesn’t care if the food is perfect, he is moved just because you tried. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Men like to be surprised too. Put in some effort. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He loves his friends more than some people love their parents. If you love him, love them too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His parents are great folks. They are bad parents but they are nice people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you put your arms around him while you are both sleeping you will feel safer than you have ever felt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you rest your head on his chest, you will know true calm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can make him laugh, you are the luckiest woman in the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cherish him. Please. He is amazing. He deserves to be made happy.&lt;/p&gt;

,BreakUps,"Looking back I see all the pain you caused in me. How possessive you were in the beginning, how you idealized me. How you were never really interested in my life. We were always doing your things. How you avoided honest real conversations with me. How I was the only one really working on us. And when I brought something up you just didn’t really discussed with me. You were so afraid to lose me - I thought it was because you loved me. But it was because you were afraid to be alone. You loved my love, my support. You benefitted from me. I cared for you - but did you really care for me? 

I put you first, I gave you so much of my time and energy. I sacrificed important parts of my life to be with you. I let down friends and family, until I was so alone. I let down my career because of you promises. Promises you made when you were afraid to be alone. That is when it started and you called me too dependent - even though you always wanted that. 

You had an emotional affair in front of my eyes, while I begged you to stop it. You saw my pain but you didn’t prioritize me. 
You brought up stuff you didn’t like about us and me that I never heard of. You didn’t like it when I was being myself or when I decided to follow my own dreams. I think you were afraid of me somehow. 

You did ignore my pain. You just tried to solve it superficially. But you never really tried to understand me. You never really asked me questions or tried to get to know my life. 
Did you ever really know me? 
There were so much things you just adapted to. Did you ever really showed me yourself? 
You were proud of my for my beauty and my intelligence - but did you ever really liked my character? Tried to understand my intentions, values, morals? 
When you hurt me, I tried to understand you and then I tried to forgive you. 
When I hurt you, you tried to avoid the topic. You avoided me. 

You thought I am exhausting, annoying. Because you never really understood that I care and I have a deep interest for you and your intentions.I wanted to make you a better person, I wanted to grow with you. I always believed in your potential. You just let me be without even showing interest for me. You didn’t even gave my proper feedback when I craved for it. I looked for direction, but you never really knew how to be mine. 
I think you never really understood me. But did you even try to? 

All the dreams we had - weren’t they just my dreams with you? Did we ever have similarities or did you just blindly agree to not lose me? 
You said you can’t help but develop crushes for people who like you. You loved the attention of others. You loved my attention and me caring for you. If it wasn’t too exhausting or demanding. 

In the end you hurt me so bad, for months. You ignored my pain. You moved on so fast. You told me how much you care about her and don’t want to hurt her. But you lied to her and you didn’t care about hurting me. You lied and hided, even when I begged for the truth.

Did you ever felt my pain like I felt yours? 

You were afraid of losing me even though I begged you to stop hurting me. You heard me crying, you saw me breaking. But still you couldn’t take the responsibility. You were so weak and somehow addicted to my support. You forgot me so fast. You always prioritized your life over me. You never really sacrificed a part of your life for me, as I did for you. 
You wanted to be with me when I cared for you. But when I needed your caring for me because I was broken and hurt, you couldn’t give it to me. You said I ask for too much. 

I think what you had for me was a weird combination of addiction, emotional dependency and fear of loneliness. You knew that I loved you deeply.

I let down my career because of you promises. Promises you made when you were afraid to be alone. That is when it started and you called me too dependent - even though you always wanted that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You had an emotional affair in front of my eyes, while I begged you to stop it. You saw my pain but you didn’t prioritize me. 
You brought up stuff you didn’t like about us and me that I never heard of. You didn’t like it when I was being myself or when I decided to follow my own dreams. I think you were afraid of me somehow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You did ignore my pain. You just tried to solve it superficially. But you never really tried to understand me. You never really asked me questions or tried to get to know my life. 
Did you ever really know me? 
There were so much things you just adapted to. Did you ever really showed me yourself? 
You were proud of my for my beauty and my intelligence - but did you ever really liked my character? Tried to understand my intentions, values, morals? 
When you hurt me, I tried to understand you and then I tried to forgive you. 
When I hurt you, you tried to avoid the topic. You avoided me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You thought I am exhausting, annoying. Because you never really understood that I care and I have a deep interest for you and your intentions.I wanted to make you a better person, I wanted to grow with you. I always believed in your potential. You just let me be without even showing interest for me. You didn’t even gave my proper feedback when I craved for it. I looked for direction, but you never really knew how to be mine. 
I think you never really understood me. But did you even try to? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the dreams we had - weren’t they just my dreams with you? Did we ever have similarities or did you just blindly agree to not lose me? 
You said you can’t help but develop crushes for people who like you. You loved the attention of others. You loved my attention and me caring for you. If it wasn’t too exhausting or demanding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end you hurt me so bad, for months. You ignored my pain. You moved on so fast. You told me how much you care about her and don’t want to hurt her. But you lied to her and you didn’t care about hurting me. You lied and hided, even when I begged for the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you ever felt my pain like I felt yours? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You were afraid of losing me even though I begged you to stop hurting me. You heard me crying, you saw me breaking. But still you couldn’t take the responsibility. You were so weak and somehow addicted to my support. You forgot me so fast. You always prioritized your life over me. You never really sacrificed a part of your life for me, as I did for you. 
You wanted to be with me when I cared for you. But when I needed your caring for me because I was broken and hurt, you couldn’t give it to me. You said I ask for too much. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think what you had for me was a weird combination of addiction, emotional dependency and fear of loneliness. You knew that I loved you deeply. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think you ever loved me. 
I don’t know if you are even capable of true love.&lt;/p&gt;

,BreakUps,"Was friends with benefits with this guy for almost a year, and we ended things earlier this year because he was going to start seriously seeing another girl. I’ll admit that didn’t go over well for me and I took it kind of hard. I was struggling with a lot of things in my life, and that was sort of the straw that broke the camel’s back. I made some not so nice comments to his face and then removed him as a friend on social media. I was realizing I had deeper feelings for this guy than I thought and it just felt like a total rejection. I spent a lot of time looking through this sub for comfort.

We didn’t speak at all for months, and then out of the blue he texted me 3 days ago wanting to meet up over the weekend. Do not get me wrong—I knew what this was. I knew it meant nothing, I knew he just wanted sex and maybe some conversation. But I thought we would at least get a chance to talk about what happened like adults and have a decent time, and I could get real closure.

That’s not what happened. At all. He showed up without telling me he was on his way first, after I explicitly asked him to. We sat on the floor and talked for maybe 5 seconds before I got this awful feeling. It just all felt so hollow and awkward. All of the chemistry and rapport we’d built up was just...gone. He even mentioned that it was weird and said he kind of regretted coming over. I felt the same way but didn’t want to like, kick him out or something after he drove 30 minutes. But I had this voice in my head screaming that I needed to get out, that he needed to leave, that this was wrong. It was so genuinely, horribly uncomfortable that I felt like I was gonna cry.

The worst part was the way he adamantly avoided talking about anything real. It was clear the baggage from us going our separate ways was weighing us down and making things weird, but he just would not talk about it at all. Something clearly happened with the girl but he wouldn’t say anything. He’d start, then stop himself and refuse to say anything else. He shared virtually nothing about his own life, which really stung because we used to spend most of our time together talking about what was going on in our lives at the moment and being a listening ear for the other person.

It felt like I was talking to a stranger. He was talking to me like I was a stranger. We talked for maybe 10 minutes, had very brief sex, and then he left. It was so unlike every other time we’d seen each other. He didn’t kiss me, touch me (outside of the sex) and didn’t even cuddle with me. I felt like a prostitute. Sex with him has always been natural and something I wanted to do in the past, and this time it felt like something I had to do to make him leave faster. Like it was performative. I just wanted it all to be over with. I tried to send him a “hey so this is never happening again, thanks for the fun times, but bye” text after he left and it never said delivered, so I think maybe he preemptively blocked my number? Which makes me feel even more weird.

Anyways...I just feel horrible now. It’s a nauseating mix of severe embarrassment, shame, and hurt. I can’t look at the relationship the same way again. Right now it feels like all the memories, even the good ones, are tainted, and I just wish I could completely remove him from my life and my history. I have no idea how to cope with this.

,BreakUps,"I will omit names and make them up for privacy purposes. So my previous boyfriend, lets call him Dave, his family and I planned a trip to rent an expensive cabin and a car for three days. The whole time his family wouldnt speak to me about trip details so I relied on Dave to tell me what is going on. I don’t know them all very well, I have been in a serious relationship with Dave for only three months. The whole situation turns into a mess where his huge family put money down on a twenty person cabin. The cost of the cabin for me alone would be around 200 dollars for the three nights. After a week people started backing out so the remaining people are getting a more expensive bill, more and more people back out and now the cost is 400 for three days just for the cabin. I am about to back out as well when they find a last minute way to escape this huge house and get a smaller house. I was told it was cheaper but not how much cheaper. I had already paid the 400 to one family member so I got it back as it changed hands. I wanted to know what the cost was before we left, yet nobody got back to me about it. 

During the trip I made it very clear I wanted to get my own food at the store so I wasn’t eating other’s food. I have a hard time eating things other paid for due to past traumas with food costs. I talked to Dave before the trip about how uncomfortable I was eating others food and how I wanted to just get my own stuff, he was okay with this. Because the vehicle was rented by Dave’s sister and her husband nobody else was allowed to drive it. We get there, total of ten paying adults showed up and I asked if we could go to the store, everyone kept telling me not to buy food because they got a lot of food. I kept persisting to no avail, eventually eating something that night. I don’t eat very much as I am a very tiny person, I eat once to twice a day, (as I know it sounds unhealthy, I am just THAT small.) The next day I talk about going to the store, again they tell me to not buy any food. Nervous about eating I snack most the trip. I see some people are leaving early so I asked if this would effect my cost and if I was picking up the bill for people I didn’t know, they said yes. This infuriated me, however I kept expressing this to a minimum as to not ruin the trip. My boyfriend is very sensitive when I express my feelings, he always tells me how uncomfortable and upset it makes him when I say I feel anything negative. I decided to talk about it later to him, we ended up having a good time. 

We get home and I still don’t know what the bill is going to be, I know it should be cheaper than the original 400 I had been told to pay before. Later that evening Dave calls me to tell me there is a food charge of 70 dollars, I told him immediately I wasn’t going to pay that fully as I barely ate a thing and nobody told me I would need to pay food, besides, I was their guest. I was willing to pay half that charge and be done with it. This makes him extremely upset and he tells me that there should be no problem for me to pay that. I had to explain to him how little I ate, how everyone barred me from going to the store and it was either starve or eat. On top of that I was the guest on his family trip. He isn’t being very nice, so I tell him I need to hang up really fast and take some time away from the conversation. He calls back twenty minutes later and explains how he overreacted and that I was right to not need to pay the food bill, he ended up picking up that bill which is more than fair because his sister loaded up HIS fridge with the leftovers. The next day he tells me that the overall cost (326 for cabin and 64 for car) would be 390. I paid that amount to his sister. 

My family was worried I was possibly being overcharged, so we did some math with the last cabins and it seemed I had an extra 160 (roughly) I was paying, I figured it was the extra pay from the other family members, though I was told later this wasn’t the case and it made me confused. I vented again how I felt it was unfair to make me pay for his family, he then asked his sister about who paid what and informed me she picked that cost up, I still had no idea where the extra 160 was. I requested the receipt for the cabin for record purposes. Dave called annoyed and angry. He lost his patience with me because he thinks I felt his family was overcharging me and that was unacceptable of me to feel. Dave couldn’t see how I wanted a receipt to a very expensive purchase I was a part of, I was losing my patience now at this point. He started to guilt trip me for having, and I quote, “An uncomfortable conversation with my sister about the receipt.” He told me she got uncomfortable and asked questions about why and he did his best to explain. I just wanted a receipt like anyone who wanted to have a record of a big purchase, I still was curious the possible extra cost, however I didn’t voice this to him knowing it would fuel the mistrust fire. This all started to feel like those small claims court situations on the TV. My asking of the receipt made him feel I was being mistrustful of his family and he claimed I put them in a bad light. I explained to him I asked for the receipt after I paid his sister what I was told I owed. He got very nasty and started to tell me I was acting suspicious and I wasn’t being empathetic to how he felt. I told him everything is paid, I never put his family in a bad light nor accused them of trying to overcharge me and I wanted a record of this trip. I told him its all said and done and asked why he was still focused on this, everything got sorted out. To him, I still was attacking his family and I shouldn’t have felt any mistrust at all towards them. My boyfriend thinks I can’t be cautious around money and strangers?

I ended up breaking up with him during this conversation, many other things he said to me helped this decision. I later discussed this with my therapist and she is proud I stood up for myself during this, she also told me that there should have been nothing wrong with asking for a receipt. 

TL;DR

&lt;p&gt;During the trip I made it very clear I wanted to get my own food at the store so I wasn’t eating other’s food. I have a hard time eating things other paid for due to past traumas with food costs. I talked to Dave before the trip about how uncomfortable I was eating others food and how I wanted to just get my own stuff, he was okay with this. Because the vehicle was rented by Dave’s sister and her husband nobody else was allowed to drive it. We get there, total of ten paying adults showed up and I asked if we could go to the store, everyone kept telling me not to buy food because they got a lot of food. I kept persisting to no avail, eventually eating something that night. I don’t eat very much as I am a very tiny person, I eat once to twice a day, (as I know it sounds unhealthy, I am just THAT small.) The next day I talk about going to the store, again they tell me to not buy any food. Nervous about eating I snack most the trip. I see some people are leaving early so I asked if this would effect my cost and if I was picking up the bill for people I didn’t know, they said yes. This infuriated me, however I kept expressing this to a minimum as to not ruin the trip. My boyfriend is very sensitive when I express my feelings, he always tells me how uncomfortable and upset it makes him when I say I feel anything negative. I decided to talk about it later to him, we ended up having a good time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get home and I still don’t know what the bill is going to be, I know it should be cheaper than the original 400 I had been told to pay before. Later that evening Dave calls me to tell me there is a food charge of 70 dollars, I told him immediately I wasn’t going to pay that fully as I barely ate a thing and nobody told me I would need to pay food, besides, I was their guest. I was willing to pay half that charge and be done with it. This makes him extremely upset and he tells me that there should be no problem for me to pay that. I had to explain to him how little I ate, how everyone barred me from going to the store and it was either starve or eat. On top of that I was the guest on his family trip. He isn’t being very nice, so I tell him I need to hang up really fast and take some time away from the conversation. He calls back twenty minutes later and explains how he overreacted and that I was right to not need to pay the food bill, he ended up picking up that bill which is more than fair because his sister loaded up HIS fridge with the leftovers. The next day he tells me that the overall cost (326 for cabin and 64 for car) would be 390. I paid that amount to his sister. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My family was worried I was possibly being overcharged, so we did some math with the last cabins and it seemed I had an extra 160 (roughly) I was paying, I figured it was the extra pay from the other family members, though I was told later this wasn’t the case and it made me confused. I vented again how I felt it was unfair to make me pay for his family, he then asked his sister about who paid what and informed me she picked that cost up, I still had no idea where the extra 160 was. I requested the receipt for the cabin for record purposes. Dave called annoyed and angry. He lost his patience with me because he thinks I felt his family was overcharging me and that was unacceptable of me to feel. Dave couldn’t see how I wanted a receipt to a very expensive purchase I was a part of, I was losing my patience now at this point. He started to guilt trip me for having, and I quote, “An uncomfortable conversation with my sister about the receipt.” He told me she got uncomfortable and asked questions about why and he did his best to explain. I just wanted a receipt like anyone who wanted to have a record of a big purchase, I still was curious the possible extra cost, however I didn’t voice this to him knowing it would fuel the mistrust fire. This all started to feel like those small claims court situations on the TV. My asking of the receipt made him feel I was being mistrustful of his family and he claimed I put them in a bad light. I explained to him I asked for the receipt after I paid his sister what I was told I owed. He got very nasty and started to tell me I was acting suspicious and I wasn’t being empathetic to how he felt. I told him everything is paid, I never put his family in a bad light nor accused them of trying to overcharge me and I wanted a record of this trip. I told him its all said and done and asked why he was still focused on this, everything got sorted out. To him, I still was attacking his family and I shouldn’t have felt any mistrust at all towards them. My boyfriend thinks I can’t be cautious around money and strangers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up breaking up with him during this conversation, many other things he said to me helped this decision. I later discussed this with my therapist and she is proud I stood up for myself during this, she also told me that there should have been nothing wrong with asking for a receipt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR 
Boyfriend of three months was upset I wanted a receipt for a big purchase I made with his family because it made him feel I wasn’t trustful of them. He felt I was attacking his family and I decided to break up with him. Therapist told me I made the right decision.&lt;/p&gt;

,BreakUps,"It's going on six months months since my ex(f26) and I(m29) broke up and I don't think theres been a day that's gone by that i didn't think about her. 

We talked a few times in March and April about getting back together, but we just decided to let it be,  we've had no contact since June 1st when I wished her happy birthday. 

I broke up with her because of a fight she started. I felt she was giving me an ultimatum, demanding I give her a timeline when I'll marry her and start a life together. I said 'someday' she said ""you're all talk no action""I wasn't having any of that and broke it off. In hindsight she started the fight not because she was being a bitch but because of some insensitive, self deprecating thing I said about our future kids, like 'they probably wouldn't amount to shit' (i have a bit of an inferiority complex) a couple weeks prior which apparently really pissed her off but she didn't show it at the time. So it built up over a couple weeks and it all came out in like an aggressive attack on me. So I break it off and run home to my mom and sister and console in them like a little bitch. My ex wasn't always their favorite and they  commend me for standing up for myself. It definitely influences me to stick to the break up.

I've been marginally employed for years, and completely unemployed since covid. I used the time off and away from my ex to better myself and I finally landed a job with a salary, benefits, and a track for promotion, but pretty demanding. This job is in the same neighboring city my ex lives in  and practically in the same neighborhood.  

Between this job and my ex's mom posting on fb that they're looking for a new roommate to help pay rent on their townhome I cant help but think this is a sign to reach out. We really loved each other a lot, and we had a fight and I just threw in the towel like a quiter.

She's got a new boyfriend, two months now they've been together.

 We both keep pictures and videos of us together on social media, which isn't weird for me but really weird for her, she usually deletes all pics of her exes from fb. She hasn't posted anything of her new guy. I think she might just be using him to distract her idk. And he lives like 120 miles away.

It’s been a fun 5 year relationship. You really mean a lot to me. And I’ll always cherish the memories we shared together. I know we had our ups and downs. We had our greatest moments together and our lowest moments together. We stuck it through together. Unfortunately all good things must come to an end.

It hurts my heart so much. I can’t sleep or eat. You’re the first thing on my mind and the last thing on my mind. It hurts to know that you moved on and found somebody. I’m stuck on the memories of you. I can’t stop replaying the best moments with you. “When I think of us I always seem to smile because I was happy for awhile and I don’t know if I could smile again.” I feel like I’m lost at sea. I tried so hard to fix what we had. I kept trying and trying and I felt like I couldn’t do anything. I wish I could tell you that you saved me.

I don’t know when I’ll be ready for a relationship again but I have to learn to be alone for awhile.

,BreakUps,"Hi um so I was broken up with about a month and a half ago. She's going through something with her family so we decided to call it just friends for a little bit. Next thing I know I'm being told that she wants to see what else is out there, that I'm an amazing guy, but how does she know I'm the one if she's never been with anyone else. She said that she'd like to date me again someday and I'd love for us to get back together someday too because I still love her. Now the part I don't understand why does part of me feel betrayed? Why does my anxiety keep telling me that she left because I wasn't good enough? Why can't I get her out of my head? Why does everything make me think of her?

Hi everyone. Long story short, my now ex-boyfriend and I decided it was best if we parted ways this evening. We haven’t seen each other since March due to covid (FUCK covid, by the way) and we don’t know when he’s coming home. He doesn’t feel the way he used to feel about me, and I finally brought up the corresponding change in behavior (lack of affection, affirmation, etc.) because I couldn’t avoid it anymore. The conversation was equally hard on both of us, and although I hate how I feel right now, and how I know I’m going to feel for a while, we both know it’s best because we both deserve to be happy. I love him so much and he is an amazing person, it all just sucks because of how badly I just wanted him to come home so we could get back to our normal... that’s literally all I wanted, but here we are. Overall, that shit freakin hurted.

We acknowledged we didn’t know how to navigate this with regard to social media. We don’t want to completely disconnect right now because of how different this is from any other breakup we’ve experienced, and because we still care about each other as much as we do. I told him flat-out that if I needed to cut things off for the sake of my mental health, I would, and he understood that. I unfriended him on Snapchat/resigned our words with friends game just to get it done (it used to be our thing) and that’s all I’m planning on for now, maybe Venmo too but tbd.

With that, I’m still figuring out how to approach our relationship status on Facebook. At one point or another, we’ll need to change it. I’m distraught over it and not sure what to do, though, because I don’t want to be the one to do it to have him discover it as I don’t want to hurt him, but I also don’t want the same thing to happen to me because I’ll have to go through the pain in yet another wave. Part of me wants to just rip the bandaid off but I hate the idea of making things worse for him (I had never seen him sob like that throughout our entire relationship, it broke my freaking heart). What time frame would be appropriate and respectful to take it off of my profile? I *know* I’m overthinking this, but I want to make sure I’m doing this in a way that’s as loving and kind as I can.

And I started hanging out with friends after I realise that I really was not exactly happy in the relationship. I still love her, even if she doesn’t feel the same, but I love her less and less the way I used to, and more out of care as a friend.
But sometimes it feels like I hit a rock. Like yes, the initial stage of me realising I’m happier without her passed, but I’m just stuck, going by everyday “realising” I’m better off this way. I still miss her everyday(although it doesn’t mean I want her back), I think about her everyday and frankly it’s getting tiring. How long more do I have to think of her everyday before I truly move on? How long more do I have to remind myself I’m better off without her before I can finally go a day without her crossing my mind?&lt;/p&gt;

,BreakUps,"Tldr: I’m a little confused because my ex and I broke up almost a week ago, he dumped me because he lost feelings and I was super devastated but I’m already feeling like I’ve mostly moved on? 

He was my first love and first relationship and we lasted almost 3 years. I was deeply in love in with him. We rarely fought and mostly whenever I was unhappy about something about our relationship, I could bring it up and we would figure out a solution. About one year ago, out of the blue, he admitted his feelings had gone down for me and told me all these things he didn’t like about me and that annoyed him. I was shocked because he either never mentioned any of these things before or he never made any of them seem like a big deal. And I agreed, some of these things he mentioned I could definitely work on and I did work on them so hard this last year. It was so strange because he always put up a happy front and out of nowhere when he brought this up, he was so serious and it was almost scary seeing such a flip in personality. 

After this incident, I remember promising myself that if he ever pulled this again, that I was better than that and I wouldn’t be begging for another chance again. It took me over a month to fully trust him again and I thought everything was great again. I really did work on the things he told me to work on and in this most recent breakup he did mention that I had improved so much and that I was so supportive. But now he apparently found new little things to get annoyed about about me. Once again, I begged him to reconsider but this time he was adamant in his decision to breakup. He said that he had expected me to pick up on things he got annoyed about without him telling me and that there’s only so many things he can communicate to me. That it frustrates him that I don’t realize these annoying little things and it just wouldn’t work out between us. It was insane to me because every 2/3 months I would actually check up on him and ask if everything was good between us, and if he had any doubts, etc. It was a conditioned response from what happened last year. I was so scared of that happening again that I told myself I would try my best to fill in the gaps where he wouldn’t communicate by asking him and that hopefully he would share... well apparently he didn’t. 

This breakup was very amicable, although he dumped me, I honestly believe he was 100% a good guy and he said the same to me. I asked him a lot of questions and he gave me answers for all of them. It was a good breakup. There was a lot of crying on my part but I realized that I didn’t feel any anger towards him. That it wasn’t ever going to work out and this is something that is like clockwork for him, letting little issues build up and releasing his frustrations all at once. I acknowledged it wasn’t my fault because I was always willing to work on things and grow together but if the other party isn’t willing to do the same, we will never work out. I let go of my anger towards him because he did both of us a favour. I loved him so hard but if he couldn’t do the same back for me then he wasn’t worth my time. To me, he doesn’t understand the concept of a relationship. Communication and working on your problems is so important and that butterfly feeling isn’t always going to last. There’s been days where I didn’t feel crazy in love with him but that doesn’t mean that I didn’t love him. 

This subreddit has honestly helped me so much. I read through it and took as much advice that applied to me as possible. First, I gave up hope that we would reconcile. I think it was so easy for me because this literally happened a year ago. Once I did that, I felt so much clarity and I was able to think back to our relationship and how much energy I put into our relationship and how many things I compromised for him without those rose-tinted glasses. There were big things I compromised on just because I loved him. I started journaling on my phone like crazy. Any thoughts that came to me were written down. I started lists. Daily journals of how I was doing, what I want in an ideal partner, things I was unhappy about in our relationship, I even wrote him letters. Sometimes it was hard to write certain things down that I was unhappy about because I never let myself admit it during the relationship. It was something I looked past our entire relationship. I also let myself grieve whenever I felt sad. I let the tears come and I’d think about us and cry but I would end it off on why it would never work out the second I felt any hope. He would have done the same thing to me in a year again. I also confided to close family and was able to talk to people important to me. I was able to keep myself occupied by hanging out with friends and family but still gave myself alone time to contemplate and grieve. Oh! And lastly I went no contact the day after we broke up. That has helped tremendously! 

All in all, I was able to realize my worth this past week and i am happy that this breakup happened because it truly would never have worked and I was able to grow so much in a week. I now know my dealbreakers and things I will no longer compromise on for anyone. Our relationship was great but now I’m realizing that even though I had an amazing time, he was always harbouring issues which means it wasn’t this once in a lifetime romance. But that doesn’t mean that the past three years of my life were shit and that I’m going to erase them. They are fond memories I’ll always look back at. I’m so happy that this breakup happened now because I have felt so much personal growth. And I still feel sad sometimes like yesterday but I didn’t feel sad enough to cry. And believe me when I say I tried. I feel a little afraid that I’m in denial and I’m going to break down randomly in a few weeks but I’m trying to let myself ride out all the waves of sadness, etc. whilst knowing I’m going to be better one day. I know it’s not a linear process but I mostly have felt better the past few days. And I want to be single for a few months before attempting to date again. I think some part of me was scarred after last year and it never recovered. So when this happened again, it hurt so bad in the moment he broke up with me but it was all uphill from there because I knew I could do better and I just let go of what I thought we were.",t2_k0pgc,False,,0,False,Somehow I have mostly moved on in just a week,[],r/BreakUps,False,6,,0,,False,t3_iir031,False,dark,0.92,,public,17,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,17,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598730025.0,text,6,,,text,self.BreakUps,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tldr: I’m a little confused because my ex and I broke up almost a week ago, he dumped me because he lost feelings and I was super devastated but I’m already feeling like I’ve mostly moved on? &lt;/p&gt;

,BreakUps,"Alright im just going to post this because i got no one to tell

So just to get this clear i am 15 and this was all my fault. No i am not heart broken i think but i know i broke hers. Im not one of those fake depressed teens. but okay here it is

So this girl Lexi and I were together for about 7 months or somethin (i know its not that long) and i would say it was the best time of my life everything was going perfect, good grades, nice teachers, a sibling, i got closer with my parents, idk just everything was going well. Me and her were always together on either Fridays or the weekend and we would just spend so much time together and i felt in love man:/ i felt like nothing could rip us apart. I met her parents and they surprisingly liked me and her 3 little brothers loved me man:/ Then shit started happening like my parents started saying shit about me and her and then my friends were getting pissed at me then every single fucking day we argued (my parents) about her and i just couldnt no more that shit was getting to my head i wanted to idek man everything was just feeling off. So i did the dumbest thing i could’ve ever done in my life and broke up with her. she was in tears:( and it hurt me so fucking much and idek what i was thinking and i regret so much now i cry sometimes about it. She was my everything and i know it was just teen love and shit but idk it felt like more than that:/ and i hate myself so much for doing that and now of course she’s moved on because its been a whole year and i understand that i respect her for that for being strong, but it hurts me now and i guess i got what i deserved:( it just sucks so much all because of what other people were saying about me and her idek why i did it i shouldn’t of let that effect me and her.

&lt;p&gt;So just to get this clear i am 15 and this was all my fault. No i am not heart broken i think but i know i broke hers. Im not one of those fake depressed teens. but okay here it is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this girl Lexi and I were together for about 7 months or somethin (i know its not that long) and i would say it was the best time of my life everything was going perfect, good grades, nice teachers, a sibling, i got closer with my parents, idk just everything was going well. Me and her were always together on either Fridays or the weekend and we would just spend so much time together and i felt in love man:/ i felt like nothing could rip us apart. I met her parents and they surprisingly liked me and her 3 little brothers loved me man:/ Then shit started happening like my parents started saying shit about me and her and then my friends were getting pissed at me then every single fucking day we argued (my parents) about her and i just couldnt no more that shit was getting to my head i wanted to idek man everything was just feeling off. So i did the dumbest thing i could’ve ever done in my life and broke up with her. she was in tears:( and it hurt me so fucking much and idek what i was thinking and i regret so much now i cry sometimes about it. She was my everything and i know it was just teen love and shit but idk it felt like more than that:/ and i hate myself so much for doing that and now of course she’s moved on because its been a whole year and i understand that i respect her for that for being strong, but it hurts me now and i guess i got what i deserved:( it just sucks so much all because of what other people were saying about me and her idek why i did it i shouldn’t of let that effect me and her. And i’ve tried talking to her but she just ignores me now which i absolutely understand. Now im 15 and she’s going to be 16 in november. idek man i just i can’t believe what i’ve done she was 100% loyal and i was too like we were happy. Anyways i dont know if anyone sees this thanks for atleast reading it i just had to get this out.&lt;/p&gt;

,BreakUps,"So I was in a relationship with my ex for 5 years. Over three years I dealt with many of his mistakes. He would lie to me, hide the fact that he was still having contact with his ex, and at a point made me feel less of a woman after I gave birth to our daughter.

At 3 years I sort of gave up on our relationship. I started focusing on me and my daughter. I stopped caring about what he was doing. He claims that it is at this point he started to change for me, but honestly it was too late. I became numb to the relationship. I was just there for my daughter. When I started my new job I met this guy who made me feel something special. I started talking to the new guy and slowly gained some feelings for him. Now before trying to start something new I tried breaking things off with my boyfriend (now ex) but he refused to end the relationship.

I tried three different times to end our relationship, but he claimed I couldn't do that because we have a family together, he loves me so much, and that he's doing so much to change for me. I honestly feel like I can't look at him the same way anymore.

I engaged in a romantic relationship with the new guy. I know maybe it was wrong on my part. He made me feel in love again. It was probably the happiest I've been in a long time.

However my ex found out about my new partner. He begged me to leave him and to stay with him because he's willing to show me how much he's changed, how much he loves me, and provide a great future for me. He's been constantly begging me to stay with him knowing very well that my feelings for him are gone.

He likes to make me feel bad for what I did. He then stated that he would have no reason to live without me. Then he proceeded to make things up about my new partner saying that he's a cheater and a liar. That he's just using me because I'm vulnerable.

Last night he was begging me to stay with him. To start new. I told him that I didn't want to continue with the relationship. Today I find out he cut himself. Now I don't know if he's using it as a tactic for me to feel bad. But he constantly tries to rub it in my face that he's extremely upset and possibly depressed.

,BreakUps,"So been almost a year since my breakup with my ex of 2 years. It was super messy and we still hooked up until march. Had space, and tried to be friends to soon but it all messed up my head. 

Well today, i dont know why, but my heart feels so heavy. Been no contact for almost 2 weeks and i feel like i cant see her for a long time, if ever again.

I reacted really terribly by getting drunk alot and messaging her alot, trying to change her mimd. The reason for the breakup was my depression which made me feel quite abandoned because I'd always helped her when she went through tough times but the first time I had issues she left.

Now i have really low self esteem, not as depressed as i used to be but today its come back full force. Thinking about what shes up to now, making a life without me, breaks my heart. I wish i could take my mind off it but i just cant.

I loved her so much, still do. 2 weeks ago she said doesnt love me anymore so i guess thats that. I just cant stop overthinking all the mistakes i made in the breakup. I reacted really terribly by getting drunk alot and messaging her alot, trying to change her mimd. The reason for the breakup was my depression which made me feel quite abandoned because I&amp;#39;d always helped her when she went through tough times but the first time I had issues she left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now i have really low self esteem, not as depressed as i used to be but today its come back full force. Thinking about what shes up to now, making a life without me, breaks my heart. I wish i could take my mind off it but i just cant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I exercise alot nowadays, still seeing friends and trying to focus on hobbies. But whenever im alone in the evenings trying to unwind it all comes back to this empty feeling in my heart.&lt;/p&gt;

The only time we have spoken since was your happy birthday text to me in July, a get well text after a surgery 2 weeks after that and today. Today some underclassmen in our school made an anonymous insta page posting fake rumors and posted that me, you, and my ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend all had orgies together (definitely must be underclassmen). I posted that the account should be reported after that rumor page and I dm-ed. You responded which surprised me saying ""love it:("" to which I replied whoever was doing that is an idiot. You responded with ""facts, I'm sorry they posted that it made me angry"" to which I said that it wasn't your fault and that I was sorry too.

,BreakUps,"My ex-boyfriend and I had gotten into a relationship really young. I was 14 and he was 15. We ‘talked’ for 5 months ish and he finally asked me out (after we did the deed). Him and I hit it off right away when we first got together, we always worked really well. We had our little arguments every once in a while but always came back within the hour. Nothing too serious. About 2 years into the relationship he ended things all of the sudden one day saying he didn’t know what he wanted in life and he was stressed. So I said okay, but I want for us to work this out. At this point him and I were bestfriends and knew we wanted to spend our lives together ( I know, I know, too young). Well, a couple hours went by and he was right back at my side. He said he was sorry and was just stressing out about the future. He was starting his senior year and had yet to take his SAT/hadn’t done any college planning. Things went back to normal and were amazing until about 6 months later the same thing happened. He was back at my side even faster this time. But it got to me, I didn’t know why he was leaving me. After this we were doing great, we worked together smoothly, went on vacation together, hung out lots, and loved eachother more than anything. But there was one problem. He wasn’t putting effort into the relationship the way he used to. Our phone conversations were dry ( yet in person was AMAZING) and he didn’t get me little presents anymore or take me on dates or write me little letters. But I asked him about it and he said I was crazy for thinking anything. He said he was just fine and loved me more than ever. Well. This past Thursday he texted me and told me he needed to talk. He told me he hadn’t been feeling it and has been faking everything for the past few months and that he doesn’t love me. Now- this wouldn’t surprise me if he wasn’t all lovey dovey in person. But he was, he was constantly asking me when we were wanting to get engaged and how when he finished college through the military we could get married right away and have a family. We would cuddle and the look in his eye just made my heart beat so fast. I knew that boy was in love with me. And then a couple days later. This. He is a very genuine guy, he never cheated or thought about it. He was always all there for me and has told me after the breakup to not worry about that because he isn’t getting into a relationship until he ‘finds himself’ which is the reason he gave me the first day (Thursday). It started off with: he needed to find himself, to he lost feelings, to he didn’t love me anymore. During the first two he would text me and tell me he still loved me so so much, but apparently that changed all in the last day. 

Now, we were both a good boyfriend/girlfriend. We were always there for each other and listened and we hung out with friends and family and enjoyed eachother constantly. I guess my question to you guys is- How do I know to give up? I know he is stressed and trying to figure out his life, and while he showed me he loved me. He said he didn’t anymore. Which is crazy considering the conversations two days earlier. Would you leave someone you love? Especially the way he did it? 
I’m sure I have missed some stuff but I think I covered just about everything.

,BreakUps,"It’s been nearly two weeks since he dumped me out of no where. I was struggling so bad at first just because I couldn’t make sense of it. Some people say they would do anything for someone and I really did. I went the whole 9 yards. I moved back to my home town so we could live together. I hate my home town. Then I moved again. He wanted to live in an old family home, I thought it’d be awesome and we could make it our own. He got a new job offer across country and decided he was going and I had to stay behind. I painted the whole house on my own, put everything in it and made it into a home for us. He decided he was staying away longer term and wanted me to go up as well. I left all my family and moved across country with him.. a few days after moving I found out he cheated on me multiple time’s, the first time being on my birthday and I was stuck and so confused. Living with him and his family, had none of my own family around and felt so alone. He cried so hard when he got caught. I went to console him. For cheating on me. Watching him cry made me hurt. I loved him so much. I couldn’t watch him cry. I know that’s stupid. Consoling him for cheating on me. But it is what it is. I decided to stay and work on it. Maybe we’d come out stronger. But I told him there could be no more lies. I started getting very depressed being away from my family after going through this traumatic experience... I told him I needed to go back home. He said he couldn’t and broke up with me. Ok cool. A couple days later, he got laid off and said he wanted to come with me and work on our relationship. We did. 

When we got home, he suddenly got sick and we found out it was vertigo. I did everything for him then as well. Took him to the appointments, picked up his meds, set alarms on MY phone to give him his meds, made sure he never missed any. Made sure he was always comfortable. He couldn’t sleep in bed anymore and needed to sleep on the couch so he could sit up more while sleeping so I slept on the recliner in the living room for months so he wouldn’t be alone. I chose to do that and I’d do it again. I loved him. I would’ve done anything. He always got mad at me tho. For no reason. It could’ve been something really small. One morning I asked if he wanted me to make him a tea and he said “DONT TALK RIGHT NOW FUCK”. He later apologized saying he was just feeling sick but I put up with that often. Him just being mean and then apologizing later. His family thanked me for being there for him. They know how he can be.

His parents liked me mostly because I was a good influence on him I guess. When we first met, he was heavy into drugs but wanted to make a change. I just supported him and spent a lot of time with him and shared some encouraging words everyday and a couple months into our relationship and he’s clean. He stayed that way for over a year. It was kinda easy because he didn’t have to be around it. I never drank or smoked or did anything like that. 
When we moved back home he started smoking pot again, I didn’t really want him to but I couldn’t say anything. It’s his life. I just showed him support constantly. Our relationship lasted two years and I gave my all. I did everything I could. Truly. He dumped me a couple weeks ago saying he just can’t be happy with me and then yesterday, he moved across country to be with his family again. I feel tired. I feel like for two years, I poured my heart and soul into somebody who never appreciated it or even wanted me to. He also said he couldn’t stay around and just wait for me to heal from the cheating. He said he was tired of feeling bad about the fact that he cheated on me. I can’t help what he chose to do. And I can’t help he felt bad about it. I tried helping him feel better, I held him whenever he cried and was always a shoulder for him and he still left. I’m slowly realizing I have to be more careful with who I give my all to.

When we moved back home he started smoking pot again, I didn’t really want him to but I couldn’t say anything. It’s his life. I just showed him support constantly. Our relationship lasted two years and I gave my all. I did everything I could. Truly. He dumped me a couple weeks ago saying he just can’t be happy with me and then yesterday, he moved across country to be with his family again. I feel tired. I feel like for two years, I poured my heart and soul into somebody who never appreciated it or even wanted me to. He also said he couldn’t stay around and just wait for me to heal from the cheating. He said he was tired of feeling bad about the fact that he cheated on me. I can’t help what he chose to do. And I can’t help he felt bad about it. I tried helping him feel better, I held him whenever he cried and was always a shoulder for him and he still left. I’m slowly realizing I have to be more careful with who I give my all to. I feel empty and broken now. Almost lost. I still kinda don’t know what to think of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not even following this depressing subreddit, yet I check it compulsively, as if it were the news. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I received a text message from you. I have kept count how many days ago have passed since things ended... our relationship ended with a text message three weeks ago. Not even a passionate one. It was polite, professional and courteous. Sterile. Cold. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years of my love, feelings much deeper on my part, all to end heartlessly in a simple string of text. That deep, lurking knowing that you never touched their life, that your existence to them was a convenience not a necessity? It&amp;#39;s true. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So no, it&amp;#39;s not you. It will never be you. I will live my life without a single word from you again. And that is a pain that I alone will bear. Someone take my phone away.&lt;/p&gt;

,BreakUps,"I(19M) broke up with my girlfriend(19F) today, but we still both love each other very much. We were best friends and it was mutual, but I initiated it. I'm asking for advice.

I'm having huge abusive family problems at home, and I don't think I can fix them. It's changed who I was since the beginning of the relationship(2yrs) . These issues were hurting my girlfriend too much. So much so that she could barely do anything else other than worry about me. **I couldn't see her like this anymore**, so we had an hour long talk and have decided to just be friends for now. We both broke down in tears.

I took whatever stress I brought to her away, and we are hoping to heal; to regain our piece of mind. We both know I've changed due to my parents, and that leaving them will fix me, but I can't right now. I have to attend and pay for college.

We aren't talking anymore, its been agreed to just act as we do with normal friends. Before I left she called me the ""love of her life, I don't know how but I just know it"". She said ""**this breakup doesn't have to be forever**"", and I really do hope after time apart we get back together.

(RELATIONSHIP BACKGROUND)

I've dated girls before, and my now ex-girlfriend has slept around in her past. We became best friends after she helped me through my last breakup, and I developed feelings for her (after my rebounds). Over the course of our two year friendship, I asked her out and got rejected 3 times. I left our friendship for two months, but then she came back. She said she was scared of commitment, but finally realized she found real appreciation and validation from being with me. We fell in love with each other's personalities. We've also talked about wanting to marry each other multiple times.

(FAMILY ISSUES)

I've become a bitter, lifeless boyfriend. I'm not as enthusiastic as I used to be. My parents have been putting so much stress on my mind that whenever I see my girlfriend, I'm practically venting and just worn out. She knows I just need time to get back on my feet, but that task seems impossible due to the fact I must live with them for another two years. When COVID-19 ends and I'm finally out and in school, the stress of living in my house will disappear.

To end this all, I just want to hear some advice as to what to do next. We both still love each other, but we just can't maintain a healthy relationship right now. I can't let her be the one to get away. Do I do NC and respect our breakup? Do I reach out to her? If so how long should I wait? Or do I just wait until we both start college together in January? (same college)

I don't want to lose her, she's my best friend.

,BreakUps,"My ex and I dated ""officially"" for about 2 months but prior to that were talking for about 1.5 months. From the beginning we immediately hit it off, we both enjoyed each others company and clicked very well. There was a real genuine connection, which was something I had never experience before. There also was a few red flags in the beginning as well, but I had ignored them because this ex felt like they really liked me. However, we both agreed things were rushed quite a bit and never really had a ""feeling out"" period with each other. My ex was very self reliant upon myself for their happiness, sort of clinging to me early on. Like I said though, I had never experience this sort of connection before so at first it was fine but then as time went on it became annoying. I also felt like I would have to pre-clear anything I wanted to do (i.e hang with friends) with them. This became a big issue for me, to the point where I had broken up with them initially. We were separated for roughly a day ish but within the interim they had been active on dating sites. We eventually talked things out and got back together and I expressed how I felt and we both agreed wed work on it moving forward. They had told me they would delete all of the apps as well.

,BreakUps,"It been a little over a month since the break up (they broke up with me, it was a 3 year relationship, the break up was awful) and I've developed a major crush on a new personal trainer at my gym. We are very friendly and flirty every-time I go to work out.

I have the urge to ask them out but idk if it's too soon.

I don't want to get back with my ex, I don't want to hear from them, most of the time I'm not missing them either because we were long distance so.... not much of my life has really changed.....just less phone calls.

Is it too soon to want to date? The only reason I question it is that the thought of me telling the person I like that I have only been single for a month makes me scared for their reaction..... I feel that it looks really bad. But I don't feel this is some kind of re-bound or my attempt to fill a void as I'm used to being independent and only hearing from my ex- SO once a day.

Yup, that's her. Anything I think about revolves back to her. The worst is the sexual stuff. She's been 1 of 2 girls I've been with in bed in my entire life (I'm 21) and we just spent 8 years together. So yeah, that shit just plays all night in my head. How we used to be together. How she's not mine anymore. Who's gonna be taking my place. And that's not such a bad thing, it has been a long time and our relationship is practically burnt out. Just doing it for the kids + the sex + the company of each other yknow. 

Shit just sucks. To make things worse, I saw her at a bus stop in our town with some dude who looked at least 35+ (she's 19) and needless to say it took every fiber of my being not to get out and cause damage to the guy. I just kept telling herself ""it's her life, not mine, she's an adult she can make her own choices"" but the thing is she CANT lol. She was literally just released from a psychiatric hospital a month ago. She's on 7 different meds. She couldn't defend herself or consent if shit got really bad (we live in a state with almost the highest kidnapping, trafficking, etc) scares the hell out of me. I'm supposed to be her man, the guy who defends her, and now that that's over there's some scary fucking dude's out there with no morals and no good intent. Why would a 35+ year old man be interested in anything a psychotic 19 year old is rabbling and babbling about?? Half the shit she said doesn't make sense, but fuck it man as long as she's safe IDC.

If you let it, I know heartbreak can and will throw you into a rabbit hole of just feeling like all you can do is sit around and hope. Don’t hope. I came home from work today and My heart rate immediately increased because I thought maybe she would have left me a text and said something along the lines of “we need to talk, I’m just confused” or anything saying she changed her mind. Yesterday I got pissed off because I saw so many posts just saying to abandon hope and I was just thinking “It’s not that simple, I can’t possibly just move on. I need to come up with a game plan to get this girl back.” I’m done with that now. Throw away hope because it only keeps you from having a clear head and healing. Yesterday I was just like you but today I’m telling you trust me you’ll do better without it. 

By this point you probably feel like you’ve been through too much with this person to just move on. Or at least that’s how I felt. I’ve realized and so should you that’s it’s best to move on. I’ve seen 80 year olds get divorced because one of them cheated when they were younger (can’t remember what sub it was in, mad lads I think?). It’s never too late to restart and try again. I like to imagine myself in 20 years sitting in a restaurant across from a woman who would walk through hell and back. Don’t settle for anything less.

Stop thinking about what you should have done and start thinking about what you could do. What could you do to make a next time better? This time around you’ve seen what some red flags look like and you can be smarter about avoiding them. This isn’t punishment, this was a lesson that you need to learn from and should help make you a better person. Your pain will fade and so will mine. Find the courage and take steps to be a better person wether being a better person means making yourself even more of a catch or just being able to spot red flags, find something to work on. Make them realize it was their loss. Let tomorrow be the first day of the rest of your life.

The pain that a breakup causes is one of the worst I have ever felt. I’m sorry that anybody has to be scrolling through this sub. I hope nothing but the best for you and hope we can all grow stronger together.

I tried to play it off as a joke, saying, ""wow thanks that worked,"" but i was actually hurt. Then he quietened and offered me something to drink. Then when i got home, i texted him hey i got home safe, he would usually reply, but he saw my text and ignored.

I thought maybe something was wrong so i brought it up a few days later, saying i felt disrespected, was he angry at me about something that day? He said he was just joking and being sarcastic and he wasn't angry. Said ""sorry if i intimidate you.""

I felt like that wasn't enough so i brought it up again a few days later. My mistake, maybe i should have let it go? But his reactions after were even worse than the first issue itself.

You’re out of my league.

When she said “I only make you mad” I said “no” she kept saying the opposite so I agreed. If she would’ve said “you’re always mad” I would’ve gotten it easier. Since we were LDR she broke up with me over text. I got this weird vibe from her. Almost like she was in a hurry and scared.

I was with my Ex for 5 years, we have 2 children together, she broke up with me 5 months ago in the midst of covid, I'm man enough to admit I could've done more to keep her, I could've been the man she needed for the rest of our/kids lives but i wasn't. I know this. Then again it takes 2 and she was no where near perfect but I overlooked her issues for what I believed to be the greater picture. 

But damn 5 months down the line and I'm still a mess, I can't function properly, I've lost a load of weight and struggling so much with trying to adapt with not having her and my boys with me 24/7. I know she's out dating already, I know or atleast it appears she is so much happier without me. Financially she somehow is doing absolutely fine, yet my 60hours a week is bearly cutting it to pay for my Bill's for this tiny house I've had to move into and she has everything. 

It shouldn't be a game of who is doing better without the other but  I can't help but ache over watching her do so much better without me. Ive blocked her on every social media platform possible so I don't see something I don't want to, we talk but only for the kids. We had a good life, nice house, our kids are happy and healthy but I'm at my wits end watching her progress while I sit here stagnant, fermenting in the same spot. I'm trying my hardest to interact with new people/women, but nothing comes close to it.

Why can't I let go. Why can't I not feel jealous/hurt that somebody else has/is taking what once was my place. 5 years of memories I can't forget. I'm trying so hard to accept this and in my head I know it's done, I know it's over and I need to move on but I can't. The nightmares, the wanting, the pain in my chest everytime she crosses my mind. 

I've realised this process of the break up she had already made the decision prior to the actual split and this is why she appears fine about the whole thing. I just never saw it coming. Stupid and naive I guess.

,BreakUps,"I've been lurking on this sub for more than a month and a half now and I think it's time for me to finally leave and say goodbye. While I don't spend as much time on here, I think some posts remind me of my breakup that I'm still healing from and that I'm moving on from. This was my first breakup (I'm 23) in which my ex and I dated for nearly 2 years and 6.5 weeks later I can confidently say that I'm moving forward in my life. My ex was my first love but I know that I'll have many other loves in the future too. While being on this sub I've had the pleasure of speaking to some really kind people and for that I'm really grateful! It's amazing how the internet can bring people together based on a common experience regardless of the country they live in, language they speak, way of life etc. 

Anyway, I'd just figure I'd share my final thoughts. Despite how horrible my ex treated me (you can read my post history for context lol) I've come to the point where I don't really feel any anger towards him. I don't think he's a bad person, just someone that wasn't meant for me. I feel like we were destined to meet but not be together and I am at peace with that. I feel like the relationship taught me so much about love and life and what I value in a partner and I feel grateful for meeting him, even though our relationship ended badly. Looking back I can say the longer I would have stayed with my ex the more life would have remained stagnant. I am very ambitious and a go-getter, while my ex is more laidback and  chill. There's nothing wrong with that, but with the goals I have in life and my ambitions, he's not a suitable partner for me. One thing I've been grappling with over the past few weeks is whether you'll always love your first love. I've concluded that if you truly loved someone, you'll never stop loving them, but your love for them will change. The love you'll have will be from afar and more platonic - you'll wish them well but you won't have any real desire to get back together with them. Nearly 7 weeks on, I don't really have a strong desire to get back with my ex. The moments I do feel a bit lonely, I've realized I miss the feeling of being in a relationship rather than actually missing my ex himself. I've realized in life sometimes you don't get the answer to certain things. While I was the one that broke up with my ex, I still had a bunch of questions about why he treated me a certain way and his thought process. I've come to terms with the fact I may never get the answers to those questions, and at the end of the day I'll be okay with it.

I've also begun to go on very casual dates. I have mixed feelings about it because on one hand it feels too soon, but on the other hand it's shown me how there's other people out there aside from my ex that value what I bring to the table. The things my ex hated about me, other guys adore.

I would say I'm 65-70% back to my normal self. I've been really lucky to have a good group of friends and family that have helped me through this breakup - and I hope that you all do too. I can't imagine what it would have been like to have gone through this alone. I think the other 35-30% of my healing will come from time but also removing some things that I feel like are holding me back from healing fully - like this sub. So with that being said, thank you. I hope everyone finds what they're looking for eventually whether that's them getting back together with their ex or moving forward and healing.

,BreakUps,"Hi everyone

My gf of a year and a half broke up with me Monday.

The basic story is I don't make it feel special anymore or like no surprises etc, her best friend has just got with a new bf and she went on about him.

I'm also long distance currently as I went back to uni and live near London for my career. Unfortunately I can't do film outside London very well.

She's not sure on having kids or living near London.

She was willing to do these things for me potentially.

I wanted to compromise more but I couldn't with the job stuff at least not in entry level.

When she dumped me she said she loved me but doesn't think it can work and she needs to do it out of self respect for herself :(

We both said we need a month to ourselves to figure out what we want, so we aren't currently together.

I tried getting over her by chatting to others online flirting etc but of course that made me miss her more...

I've sent her a card in the post expressing I love her and wish to sort myself out and that she can take the time she needs to sort her stuff out.

She has admitted there's things that we both need to change to make it work.

I just miss her, few days ago we were fine or it felt fine.

I just am broken.

She said cuddle your teddy for me ( the one she got me) and I'm like it hurts too much...yet she's cuddling hers.

She was calling me our nicknames still...and like wtf .

She said to me all she can say is she doesn't want me to put my life on hold for her etc and stuff not to wait around.

It's horrible.

Any advice?

,BreakUps,"But it wasn't enough.

Matched with a girl on tinder back in May. I'm 24, she is 22. She was way more beautiful than the others I had matched with, and we had amazing conversations. She was kind, intelligent and genuinely interested in me, she really was the girl of my dreams in so many ways. She was super excited when I asked her out and instantly agreed and suggested a day. We study the same program but she is 3 semesters above me, even though she was two years younger than me. Went on 3 dates over two weeks and texted all day long before the semester ended and we had to go back to our hometowns for the summer. Everything went great, but felt it was too early to commit to anything. She was open to meeting back when university started again, but she added that ""she didn't know how she felt"" and that we'd ""have to start over from scratch"", but at the same time said she would want to keep seeing me if we didn't have summer break. And we did meet, two days ago.

When I find someone I like, I catch feelings extremely quick. It's a trait I'm proud of, but it makes me extremely vulnerable.

We talked every few weeks, and even though I was the one initiating 80% of the time, she seemed excited whenever we were in contact. She was constantly on my mind which made it difficult to get through the summer. My mind raced between ""of course it'll work out"" and ""there's no way this is going to end well"". College just couldn't start soon enough.

The date two days ago went amazing, and I got the chance to show a few sides of me she said she had been missing, mostly that we hadn't been laughing that much together. She definitely had a great time, cause she told me that twice since then. No kiss, but plenty of hugs and other physical contact.

Yesterday I texted her that I had a great time with her and felt great about us, and stated that I wanna keep seeing her. That's when she dropped the bomb on me. The bomb I had always had in the back of my mind, and that I had been fearing. She said she had a great time on the date, but didn't really know what she wants or how she feels about me, and was open to meeting again, but said it would have to be as friends. She had told me back in May she felt things was moving a bit too fast, and that she'd want to take things slower. Because of that previous statement, I was confused.

I sent her a long text asking for some clarification on if she genuinely didn't know what she wants or if she knew that whatever she wanted, it wasn't with me. I put my cards on the table and told her how I felt about her and that it would painful for me to spend time with her as just a friend, since I don't see her that way. So I said no to that suggestion.

After having cried myself to sleep I woke up to her response. *""If everything felt right, I probably wouldn't be as hesitant as I am. I guess the only thing to do is to end things here, since you don't want to be a friend"".*

Now, I'm very open with my feelings and I really believe in having some form of closure and leaving things on a good note, cause that's just the way I am. And I also wasn't content with how I framed things in my previous text. So I sent her a long text saying ""*I really wish I could be just a friend to you, cause you're a great girl in so many ways, and that's what made me like you from the start. However I feel it would be extremely painful for me, cause I'm genuinely sad about this. Me not wanting to be friends with you has nothing to do with you, it's just the entire situation, so don't take it personally. But you're a smart girl, you probably know this, but if not, now you know. I don't want you to interpret this as an attempt to get you to change your mind, I want you to see it as some form of closure. Thanks for the time we had back in May, even though things are the way they are now, and good luck with everything.""*

I wasn't expecting a response, but I got one. ""*I totally understand how you feel, and that is completely reasonable. It's been really nice getting to know you, and you're such an amazing guy. I also want to tell you that you really did do everything right and you're really sweet. Don't change anything about yourself for the next girl, cause she'll be lucky to have you.""*

That's it. I feel completely broken right now and I've been crying rivers today. It just hurts so much. It feels so unfair. When I look back, there is nothing I would do differently and there are no situations where I screwed up. I feel proud of myself.

That last part of her final message made things feel somewhat better.

Went on 3 dates over two weeks and texted all day long before the semester ended and we had to go back to our hometowns for the summer. Everything went great, but felt it was too early to commit to anything. She was open to meeting back when university started again, but she added that &amp;quot;she didn&amp;#39;t know how she felt&amp;quot; and that we&amp;#39;d &amp;quot;have to start over from scratch&amp;quot;, but at the same time said she would want to keep seeing me if we didn&amp;#39;t have summer break. And we did meet, two days ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I find someone I like, I catch feelings extremely quick. It&amp;#39;s a trait I&amp;#39;m proud of, but it makes me extremely vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talked every few weeks, and even though I was the one initiating 80% of the time, she seemed excited whenever we were in contact. She was constantly on my mind which made it difficult to get through the summer. My mind raced between &amp;quot;of course it&amp;#39;ll work out&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;there&amp;#39;s no way this is going to end well&amp;quot;. College just couldn&amp;#39;t start soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The date two days ago went amazing, and I got the chance to show a few sides of me she said she had been missing, mostly that we hadn&amp;#39;t been laughing that much together. She definitely had a great time, cause she told me that twice since then. No kiss, but plenty of hugs and other physical contact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I texted her that I had a great time with her and felt great about us, and stated that I wanna keep seeing her. That&amp;#39;s when she dropped the bomb on me. The bomb I had always had in the back of my mind, and that I had been fearing. She said she had a great time on the date, but didn&amp;#39;t really know what she wants or how she feels about me, and was open to meeting again, but said it would have to be as friends. She had told me back in May she felt things was moving a bit too fast, and that she&amp;#39;d want to take things slower. Because of that previous statement, I was confused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sent her a long text asking for some clarification on if she genuinely didn&amp;#39;t know what she wants or if she knew that whatever she wanted, it wasn&amp;#39;t with me. I put my cards on the table and told her how I felt about her and that it would painful for me to spend time with her as just a friend, since I don&amp;#39;t see her that way. So I said no to that suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After having cried myself to sleep I woke up to her response. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;If everything felt right, I probably wouldn&amp;#39;t be as hesitant as I am. I guess the only thing to do is to end things here, since you don&amp;#39;t want to be a friend&amp;quot;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;#39;m very open with my feelings and I really believe in having some form of closure and leaving things on a good note, cause that&amp;#39;s just the way I am. And I also wasn&amp;#39;t content with how I framed things in my previous text. So I sent her a long text saying &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;I really wish I could be just a friend to you, cause you&amp;#39;re a great girl in so many ways, and that&amp;#39;s what made me like you from the start. However I feel it would be extremely painful for me, cause I&amp;#39;m genuinely sad about this. Me not wanting to be friends with you has nothing to do with you, it&amp;#39;s just the entire situation, so don&amp;#39;t take it personally. But you&amp;#39;re a smart girl, you probably know this, but if not, now you know. I don&amp;#39;t want you to interpret this as an attempt to get you to change your mind, I want you to see it as some form of closure. Thanks for the time we had back in May, even though things are the way they are now, and good luck with everything.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t expecting a response, but I got one. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;I totally understand how you feel, and that is completely reasonable. It&amp;#39;s been really nice getting to know you, and you&amp;#39;re such an amazing guy. I also want to tell you that you really did do everything right and you&amp;#39;re really sweet. Don&amp;#39;t change anything about yourself for the next girl, cause she&amp;#39;ll be lucky to have you.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s it. I feel completely broken right now and I&amp;#39;ve been crying rivers today. It just hurts so much. It feels so unfair. When I look back, there is nothing I would do differently and there are no situations where I screwed up. I feel proud of myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That last part of her final message made things feel somewhat better. But at the same time, I can&amp;#39;t even explain how much it hurts to hear that you did everything right, and it still isn&amp;#39;t enough.&lt;/p&gt;

,BreakUps,"I was dating my neighbor for 3 months after she had freshly broken up from her ex. Me and said neighbor always small talked and fancied each other since we moved in to our apartments a year and a half a go but obviously it was only after she had broken up with her ex that something happened between us. I didn't know she fancied me and she didn't know I fancied her until we got talking.  
Her ex cheated on her 3 times, once when pregnant, wasn't interested in spending time with her and they would spend their nights in seperate rooms doing their own thing...it wasn't a relationship and she was unhappy yet 3 days ago we had a talk because I could see something was off and she said she doesn't know if she's still got feelings for him.  
I told her that I understand that we probably rushed in to dating so soon after she split from her ex and really she should have taken the time to get over her ex first. At that point we agreed to seperate, it was emotional, we both cried and put it down to timing but yesterday I saw her ex come around and she got in the car and off they went.  
Now I just feel like a rebound and it sucks! Our time together was amazing, we saw each other almost every night (I know we shouldn't have!), we were fun together, she loved cuddling up to me on the sofa which she couldn't do with her ex...they barely even kissed let alone anything else, we had good sex... passionate...yet even still I think she's gone back.
I know it probably won't work between them long term and she'll find herself back in the same position, they've broken up before and got back together again so I don't see why it would work this time.  
I've unfriended her on Facebook and told her I  would rather not have any contact and it's been 2 days of no contact now. The hardest thing is that she lives directly 2 floors beneath me and there's always a chance I can bump in to her...I even close my curtain's so I don't see her walk down the road, the only exit from our apartments which is in direct view from my living room.  
I know I'll get through this, it'll be hard for a while but it just sucks! First girl I truly fell in love with in 2 years and now it's over :(  
  
I'm just venting really, I don't really know what advice anyone could give me that I don't already know from searching through hundreds of posts and internet articles. I'll stay no contact and work on myself and hopefully learn some valuable lessons from this.

I kept thinking about how incredibly alone I am.

Girlfriend broke up with me 2 months ago because of her anxiety/high pressure job. We were amazing and then 3 months ago she just switched and started to completely freeze me out.

,BreakUps,"Hey guys. So today marks two months since I’ve been dumped... and it’s been a long journey since then. A lot of self-discovery, healing, thinking, and working through my issues. I wish I could come to you today and say that I’m good; that my life is better than what it was 2 months ago. In some ways, it is. In other ways, it isn’t. 
I want to share with you all the mistakes I made that were detrimental to my own personal healing, in the hopes that those of you who are starting your journey don’t repeat these mistakes. 
First of all, just go no contact immediately, for your own healing. Doesn’t matter if it’s been a day since you were dumped or months. If you’re still talking to your ex, you’re only hurting yourself. My ex has been kind enough to never contact me, it’s always been me contacting her. I did it 5 times; the last time was about a month ago when I wrote her a long letter where I poured my heart out to her. And you know where that got me? Absolutely no where, not even so much as a response from my ex. Which looking back on, was a horrible idea for me to do. It hurt not getting the answer I was hoping for. Just cut the cord. You will be better for it. 
The sooner you block them, the better. Instagram, Facebook, snapchat, anything and everything. I finally got the courage today to delete her number from my phone, so I’m not tempted to reach out. It hurts doing this, I know, but it’s necessary for you to heal. If your ex wants to reach out, they will. Do not accept breadcrumbs. Do not respond to any “I miss you” or “I’m sorry for hurting you.” I still miss her every day, but I know I have the courage now to tell her if she ever reaches out that I never want to speak to her again unless she wants to try again. But please don’t focus on the “what if’s” or hold onto any hope that they will come back. 
It’s hard, I know. It is so so hard sometimes. But this is a wonderful community and they’ve helped me through some rough times. I just wanted to pass on some advice that I learned and hope can help you move on quicker. Here’s a virtual hug, stranger. If anyone ever feels the need to talk, my DMs are always open.

,BreakUps,"I was with this girl for 6 and a half years. It wasnt perfect, but I assumed we loved eachother thru thick and thin. The last couple of months we had been arguing more than usual. About the littlest shit. She becomes more distant. One day, last month (July), her best friends sister had a birthday get-together. I wasnt invited. I felt iffy about the whole thing. I had a gut feeling she was cheating on me. The very next day I tell her about my feelings and her response was ""I need a break"". Weird response dont you think? The next day after that she goes on a fishing trip. Just to Santa Monica pier. My instinct is going off. I felt uneasy. Cut to 2 weeks later, we have a huge talk and come to the conclusion that our attitudes are sabotaging the relationship. We both said we want to make this work. We made a list of what we need to work on. Her list is stuff she's been ""working on"" for like 6 years. But I still loved her. I was elated because she really communicated with me about what she would like to see out of me. And I felt like this is it, this is the moment where our relationship takes off. The 6 and a half years were great, a bit rocky but great, but the next six were going to be amazing. I really thought ""this is it"".

Cut to like 3 weeks later. We had great sex, throwing around I love you a lot, more passionate kissing. I take her to her moms place one day because its her sisters birthday. We make plans for 2 days later to hang out, to visit our dead pet hedgehog that passed 2 years ago that day. We say goodbye and I love you. The next day I'm working and I call her to see hows she's doing. No response. Thought that was weird but let it go. The day of visiting our hedgehog comes and I call her 3 to 4 times and no answer. Then when she finally answers, she sounds sad. She tells me she kissed another guy. She only said ""I'm sorry"", not ""it was a stupid mistake and I'll never do it again, I'm sorry"". I was livid. She suggested an open relationship. Im so pissed that my vision becomes blurry. I hang up on her and don't call her back. I did burpees to get my mind off, but I just felt numb right after. The next day is when it all hit. I just broke down...and I have been for over a week now. I sent her a long text 2 days after her cheating. I tell her to not respond because I asked questions that I know I don't want to know the answers to. Especially just 2 days after, the wound was too fresh. The very next day I start writing everything I'm thinking and feeling. 14 fucking pages. Like an idiot I send it to her. Deep down I was hoping she would be interested in trying to get thru this and make the relationship work, because I still loved her. I mail it Monday morning and just countdown the minutes and hours till I know she's received it. This time I did want a response. Every day im just breaking down. I have never felt betrayal before. My stomach is in a knot and I can feel my heart beating in my stomach. My heart hasnt stopped racing. I have labored breathing. I just think she's with him and it crushes me. I try to watch TV/movies, anything little thing about a boy/man and girl/woman wrecks me. Music? I introduced all of my tunes to her. Anything I hear reminds me of her. I do burpees and fall back to depression right after. I ride my bicycle and break down while riding. Just being outside and seeing all the happy people reminds me shes happy with this guy, while I'm just feeling devasted. I get impatient and finally decided to ask her to meet me at a park to talk. I needed to know the answers now. I knew she wasn't going to respond to my letter.

We meet up. The 2 main questions I needed answered were ""how long have you been talking to him?"" And ""have you seen him again since"". She told me he wasn't at her friends sisters party, but he was at the fishing trip with her best friend and her boyfriend. She has also continued seeing him since she cheated. She cheated not out of weakness, but to end the relationship. Goddamn does it sting. I'm so numb. I dont feel like doing anything but sleeping. But I cant sleep, I just replay her smiling face, her laughter, all the good times, experiences over and over. When I wake up I count the hours till when I'll probably get sleepy. What kills me is the excitement you get when you start dating someone...I know because I felt it with her, shes now feeling that for someone else. How could she say she loves me, plan to hang out soon, then just turn around and cheat on me, say sorry and walk away? 

I almost broke down at work. Good thing we're wearing masks because my lips were quivering. Everything reminds me of her. She cheated on me and I was still going to forgive her. She just doesn't want this relationship anymore. 

I also tried smoking weed, that makes me more emotional. I havent drank because I know that's suicide. I also had to tell my friend to tell me ""fuck that bitch"" to make me feel better. I still love her. But I feel betrayed and humilated and I dont know how to get over this. I cant sleep. I cant do.

Also, her birthday is tomorrow. I had planned a grand day. Now, she's going to be with him and he's going to show her a great time. I feel our bond, our connection fading with every passing minute. It crushes me knowing someone else is making her happy on her day of birth. Her attraction for him will only continue to grow. I cant stop thinking about it.

,BreakUps,"To my ex's mother,

10 months have passed since things ended between me and your son. In that time I’ve been able to think. I loved your son deeply and spent two years assuming that we would spend our lives together. I’m sad that this is a goal you didn’t share. He might have said the words that ended things, but it was your actions that pushed him to say them.

During the time I dated your son you:

* Blamed me for meeting you by surprise the first time (your son failed to tell you he was bringing me to see you)
* Prevented me from attending your daughter’s wedding after she invited me.
* Insisted we slept in a single bed when the spare room had an empty double.
* I brought food, it wasn’t eaten.
* I bought wine, it wasn’t opened.
* You chastised me for not helping in the kitchen with meals, but when I did offer, said I should stay chatting to others.
* At my second Christmas with you all, you asked me to take photos of everyone. (You also did this at the birth of your first two grandchildren, and at their christenings)
* I invited you to concerts, you declined.
* I invited you to dinner with my parents you declined - 40 minutes is too far to drive.
* You criticised my upbringing.
* You criticised my brother.
* You criticised my parents. (Having never met either of them)
* You said that we must move to within 15 mins drive of you, otherwise, we would “lose touch with the family”
* You bought me clothes that were two sizes too big on purpose.

You made sure I was an outsider, NOT one of the family, other different, not like you. And I said nothing, I put up with it because I loved your son. But then you went too far.

When your son began to move in with me, you couldn’t cope. You had 3 other children all moved out, but this time you wouldn’t have it. You complained that we would never see you, (I spent every weekend with you) You complained your son’s journey to work was going to be “unbearable” despite being shorter and cheaper than it currently was. You pulled out old family pictures to remind him of what he was missing. You cried repeatedly. You told him to leave half of his possessions behind “so he would have a reason to visit” You told me to have dinner waiting for him every night. You told me to shop and clean and do all of the washing for him as he would be “too busy”. (I had started a new job the previous week and your son was working 4 days a week only). You called him and cried, told him everyone was “Heartbroken” that he had “Left the family”. We were moving 40 minutes away.

When he took your side, I saw the real you. The woman who you truly were. You smiled and hugged and kissed me as your own in front of him, but it was empty. You took the misery of your own heart and projected it out onto the world for him to see, to stop him from leaving. You turned a wonderful young man into an immature coward. All because you were unhappy. I spent two years trying to please you, to lower my own goals, to stifle my sense of self, stay quiet, not to joke, not to laugh, not to draw attention. And unlike you, I have learned something.

I learned to stand up to the people like you. The foul selfish beings that stifle others for their own selfish insecurities. I will not allow anyone to tell me how to act or who to be. I am me. Through your actions, I lost my future, but I will make a new one. 

And I hope that one day, your son does too, away from you.

I blocked, unfriended, and unfollowed him on social media and it has done wonders. I just know that doing so will only delay my healing process.

The little things or everyday habits we used to do, such as sending memes or messaging whatever comes to mind, I've learned to live without out it by mentally classifying it as '*undeclared losses*'. Basically, what that does is letting my mind know that these are the things that I won't be able to do now and that I can let it go now. It's okay to remember the little things you used to do, just mentally tick it off as '*undeclared losses*'.

Keeping track of my NC streak has also been very helpful. It's so satisfying to be able to mark that entire day off as successful just because I didn't contact him. Apart from keeping myself busy, the mindset that has been helping me pull through is this: ""you just have to make it through 12 midnight today"". Nothing big or daunting.

Recently we had our first fight two weeks ago and it seemed like we were going to be able to work through things. But she told me on the phone when we were talking through stuff that she hopes we could get through this but she has a lot to think about. That’s fine, I get it. But these last couple days have been really weird...

She’s noticeably been acting different and even a bit cold towards me. We live a few hours apart so most of our conversations are via text and phone calls. I was carrying things on yesterday as usual, and I referenced an old inside joke we used to have about me being a generic hallmark boyfriend, and she said something like “I hate those movies, the stuff they say is too much.” And a few texts later after that went on I asked if she’d rather I tone down some of that stuff because I know I can be a bit extra and she said “I mean, I’m not gonna just ask you to stop doing something like that.”
Which was a really roundabout way of answering a yes or no question.
And then I had made her an “Open When” box full of letters to get her through school, and she told me there’s nothing I can do to help her with what she has going on, I said “well maybe one of those letters could help :)” and she told me “ah, I forgot I even had those.” Which hurt a lot because I worked really hard on them.

So I basically asked her straight up if she felt she was absolutely sure she still wanted to be in this relationship with me, she said “I want to say yes, but I have something on my mind.” She won’t tell me what’s on her mind, because she’s not “100% certain” on whatever it is. I told her I’m willing to be patient with her, but if there’s a potentially breakup worthy issue, I don’t want to be sitting on my hands in limbo waiting for the end to come.” She told me she would never do that to me, but it’s basically what she’s been doing for this whole week. 

I love her but I’m so lost and confused right now. Has anyone else ever been here before? What do I do? :(

,BreakUps,"I met my ex in Europe during an internship, started dating. My first relationship and it was so fun for me. I returned back to Canada and we were doing long distance. Few months later, I started a phd in Europe, partly so I can be with her. The relationship grew and it was nice, but not perfect. There were bumps. But she, about a year  later, moved to Canada to do her masters! So we swapped places!!

&amp;#x200B;

We kept doing long distance for another 2 years. It was tough. I remember always putting effort to go see her, taking time I would otherwise use to see my family to go see her. We barely spoke on phone or Skyped though, even though I insisted. She would call me just when she needed help with work.

&amp;#x200B;

Then i started becoming depressed and I didn't realize it.  I was alone in the PhD, it was very stressful both in terms of work and social life. I also felt alone in the relationship. She finished her masters, and then we broke up, mutually.

I realized I'm still in love with her, but she doesn't want me back. I started seeing a therapist, who confirmed that it sounds like I had depression and with the stress of work gone that these feelings of my ex are coming back.

Is it because I'm no longer of use to her? She recently told me it was clear to her I had depression, so why didn't she do anything about it? Am I too needy? Maybe she never truly loved me?

,BreakUps,"It’s been maybe the hardest 4 days of my life. I felt a little better yesterday, but I’ve just woken up and can’t stop crying, and can’t bring myself to get out of bed. I haven’t spoken to him since Wednesday. All I want to do is sleep, but I’m barely sleeping, and have barely eaten anything since he broke up with me. I’m already starting to lose weight. My family are worried, but there’s only one person I want to talk to and he isn’t there anymore.

I want nothing more than to have him back in my life, and I know it’s selfish because this was his decision and I should respect him, but I just want my best friend back in any capacity I can have him. I never even realised he was my best friend until now - how much of a fucking idiot can you be, to spend almost 2 years with someone and never even realise how much you took them for granted? Another Saturday I’ve woken up without him, and the first Saturday I know I’ll never wake up next to him again. I made him feel alone in one of the hardest points of his life, and I never even realised, and I’ll never forgive myself. I made him reach a breaking point I was too stupid and in love to ever realise existed. I never wanted to commit to anything before him, and I don’t think I ever will again. How could I? I’ve lost the love of my life, and I can never face giving myself to another person in the fear that I’ll ever feel like this again.

I keep wanting to contact him, because I need to give some of his things back. And why not admit it - I just need to see him one last time. He said he still wanted to be friends, but he hasn’t initiated contact since the breakup and was back on Tinder the same night he left me, so I’m guessing it was talk. I think the relationship was over for him for months, and I keep thinking back to all the happy times we’ve had together, and wonder when or if he stopped loving me. The first night we shared in his new flat, when we built his new furniture together (well, he did it, and I got in the way and occasionally passed him screws and tools). When he held me in bed after we’d been at a party, and he imagined all the nights we’d have in the future, curled up like that - on holiday, in a place of our some day, on our wedding night, with the children we’d maybe have. And less than a month later, this. I’ve heard different things from different friends, about this breakup. It was over the phone, and he wept after he finally did it, and all I want is to comfort him. But I can’t help but wonder if the tears were fake, after seeing him immediately back on Tinder. Maybe that’s one of the most selfish and insensitive thoughts I’ve ever had. I just can’t believe they were fake, that anything was fake. But maybe it was, and maybe that’ll make me feel better one day.

I think believing it was talk will make me feel better, because I’m so confused over whether what he told me was lies, and for how long it may have been lies. But I don’t think it will make me feel better. I need to talk about this breakup, but I don’t think he wants to, and I don’t want to make things worse, of scaring him away by acting crazy without realising. I have things I need to tell him, that I’ve never told anyone and I’d been building up to tell him, but I’m afraid he’ll feel guilt-tripped, and resent me. But I feel I owe him some explanation, although I know it will never be enough, and I don’t want it to be enough. I just want him to know that this has made me realise the help I truly need, and that I’ll regret forever that him leaving me was the push I needed. Maybe I need a reason to hate him, but I don’t think he could ever give me one. This was my fault, and my fault alone, no matter what he says.

He’s been having some really hard-times lately, and all I want to do is ask him about it. I want his head back in my lap, me playing with his hair, I want to make him feel better, I want to give him what I couldn’t give him at the time. I want him to know he isn’t alone, I want him to be okay.

Quick edit: I forgot to add, I dreamt about him last night, about having a talk about breaking up, I think. I don’t even think we got back together, but my heart aches for the words unsaid. All I can do is cling to the hope that things will get better, but that isn’t helping me in the here and now.",t2_7vby8pfz,False,,0,False,It’s been 4 days.,[],r/BreakUps,False,6,,0,,False,t3_iipacq,False,dark,0.99,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,1598691828.0,,[],{},,True,,1598720133.0,text,6,,,text,self.BreakUps,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been maybe the hardest 4 days of my life. I felt a little better yesterday, but I’ve just woken up and can’t stop crying, and can’t bring myself to get out of bed. I haven’t spoken to him since Wednesday. All I want to do is sleep, but I’m barely sleeping, and have barely eaten anything since he broke up with me. I’m already starting to lose weight. My family are worried, but there’s only one person I want to talk to and he isn’t there anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want nothing more than to have him back in my life, and I know it’s selfish because this was his decision and I should respect him, but I just want my best friend back in any capacity I can have him. I never even realised he was my best friend until now - how much of a fucking idiot can you be, to spend almost 2 years with someone and never even realise how much you took them for granted? Another Saturday I’ve woken up without him, and the first Saturday I know I’ll never wake up next to him again. I made him feel alone in one of the hardest points of his life, and I never even realised, and I’ll never forgive myself. I made him reach a breaking point I was too stupid and in love to ever realise existed. I never wanted to commit to anything before him, and I don’t think I ever will again. How could I? I’ve lost the love of my life, and I can never face giving myself to another person in the fear that I’ll ever feel like this again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep wanting to contact him, because I need to give some of his things back. And why not admit it - I just need to see him one last time. He said he still wanted to be friends, but he hasn’t initiated contact since the breakup and was back on Tinder the same night he left me, so I’m guessing it was talk. I think the relationship was over for him for months, and I keep thinking back to all the happy times we’ve had together, and wonder when or if he stopped loving me. The first night we shared in his new flat, when we built his new furniture together (well, he did it, and I got in the way and occasionally passed him screws and tools). When he held me in bed after we’d been at a party, and he imagined all the nights we’d have in the future, curled up like that - on holiday, in a place of our some day, on our wedding night, with the children we’d maybe have. And less than a month later, this. I’ve heard different things from different friends, about this breakup. It was over the phone, and he wept after he finally did it, and all I want is to comfort him. But I can’t help but wonder if the tears were fake, after seeing him immediately back on Tinder. Maybe that’s one of the most selfish and insensitive thoughts I’ve ever had. I just can’t believe they were fake, that anything was fake. But maybe it was, and maybe that’ll make me feel better one day.&lt;/p&gt;

I became upset when he told me he mightve been bisexual, because I felt as if he were thinking about other guys when we were together. I felt like he spent too much time playing video games and he didn’t talk to me enough, even when we called he was playing games. I took a lot of his time in school, I wouldn’t let him talk to his friend that he used to like, and he stopped going to clubs to hang out with me. Quite frankly I feel like i enjoyed my time with him more than he did with me. But it really went downhill from there. After quarantine I had an episode of complete apathy, I didnt feel anything towards him or anyone.

,BreakUps,"2 years ago I was completely myself, made lots of jokes, expressed weird thoughts that reside in me, I wasn't in love but I just liked your company. I didn't think i would ever catch feelings hard but i did almost a year later. But now, after multiple bickerings, naggings, blocking phases, stupid fights crying spells, feelings of being unheard and invalidated after explaining how I want to be showered in affection, being told that spark isn't a real concept that love isn't a movie, you just need to 'work it out"". Have made me realize, you don't know what the fuck you're talking about; if you wanted to ""work things out"" you would listen to me, i wouldnt have to keep crying about the same things. What am i fucking fighting for? I don't even get a crumb of fucking affection. I gain nothing from this situation between us. How can someone like you even grasp the concept of love? You don't, I know that deep down you don't even know how to express love and you convince your stupid brain that you do. Or maybe you are the world's coldest and most manipulative fucker out there and I'm the biggest fattest fucking fool, for being toyed by you. I don't even know his childhood or his favorite t.v. show, 2 fucking years, and I don't even know your fucking favorite hobbies. I'm so fucking mad at myself for falling for you. Why can't you just ever let me in your life? Why is it so fucking hard for you? You've seen me at my lowests, why can't you just give me an inch? Wasted fucking energy. No one is ever worth taking my energy. At times i'm convinced leaving is the right decision, but if I tell him again that I'm done for the 300th time, he won't believe me. I need a different approach, I know he's coming back to my city in a week or so, and i know he's gna want me to come pick him up at the airport, and probably hook up in a hotel room lol. Well guess what you stupid bitch, I'm not seeing you. I need to just never text him again, I need to give him lots of excuses, and when the time is right just tell him the truth, because if i tell him the truth now he'll say ""you always do this so i don't believe you"" well you should, dude. Im over you. I can easily shower someone in love, that's not a problem, how can i love someone when they don't reciprocate? My heart is stored with love ready to thawed, cooked and served, but no, it's sitting in this cold ass freezer of a heart. it's a defeating feeling and he simply just doesn't fucking care. I can't believe you are more enthusiastic and a bit flirtatious with that whore you call a friend. I'm guessing you two have history because it's fucking clear. You think you're a good liar but you're not. Get fucked you fucking cockroach. Get absolutely fucked, have fun holding down a real relationship, if you even manage to get into one. I'm more focused on my career to be honest and making new amazing friends. I don't want hookups or even a relationship, if it comes, sure whatever; i mean i wouldn't hate it, it's just the i need to clean my messy brain and heart first before I want someone who just gets me. Trying to manifest a soulmate while my soul isn't just right.. mate.. would not make sense. I would just be in the same cycle. I'm rediscovering what self-love means and this is definitely a fucking wakeup call for not only me; but you too. So my question is, have you ever been in my position? Where you give up on a relationship bc the person clearly isn't putting effort and makes you feel even more alone? How did you manage to get them out of your life?

Well guess what it’s not! It is a crappy feeling not being able to talk to them or be next to them.

,BreakUps,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. My ex (21F) and I (18F) had been dating for two and a half years as a long distance (LDR) couple. We originally met online four years ago while she was still in high school  and were close friends before we began to date. We had a pretty loving relationship but it was not without its arguments. Last year, we had a short break up that lasted one week. Since that breakup, we had been doing fine up until June during the quarantine. Our original plan was to break the distance by going to college in her home state, but after seeing it would not work out (I am low-income and got a full scholarship to attend a prestigious institution), I ended up committing to a college in another state. My ex is graduating next year so we were going to try to see if she could do her Master’s program nearby. We only were able to meet twice in secret as my mother is homophobic and did not know about our relationship. Although there were issues with us going to school in different states, we were excited at the chance to fly to see each other more and often planned our future together. 

Then comes June of 2020. A sudden family issue caused me to want to take a break as I was stressed and afraid of taking out my feelings on my ex. She ended up having to deal with her own issues with friends and family, so we mutually decided to take a break for a month. The break was made to be so that we would not take anything out on each other. Throughout the break, she would text me to check in and we would speak for a little bit. The longest NC we did during that break was two weeks which lasted until the day we decided to end the break on. The day the break ended, we chatted like normal and flirted. I asked her what our relationship status was, and she took two hours to respond to say that she was not sure and we should probably speak about it. She asked what I wanted and I said I liked the two of us together and then she said we were better off as friends. In the breakup text, she used “I think” a lot, stating “I think you were/are right, I think I have more platonic than romantic feelings for you” and “I think I communicate with people better in person.” She said she still loved me and wanted to remain friends. I was shocked, because the break was not about our relationship. But I told her I would always be there for her. When we broke up, I asked her if there was a chance we could ever get back together for closure. And she said ""maybe.""


We did one week of NC, and then she texted me. We spoke like normal with minor flirting. She would leave me on read after a couple of texts but then text me the next day again. She would leave me on read and text me every other day. We would flirt and she would repost fanart of our favorite couples online.  She randomly sent me her college schedule without me asking and asked if I could send mine when I received it. She would send me pictures of her and even send a good morning and good night text. 

I recently moved into college and we finally video called since the breakup. We acted like a couple. She flirted non-stop, teasing me constantly and asking if I was “jealous” about the “fans” she had that were swooning over her. We joked around and she even mentioned that she was looking into what she was getting me for Christmas. We even mentioned the stuffed animal she gave me that is our ""son"". At one point, she even took off her shirt (showing her bra) and changed into her pajamas in front of me. After that call, we had 2 days of NC as she was on a trip. I texted her today asking about her trip and she said that her thumbs hurt (she mentioned hurting her thumbs in our last call) so she could not text and was wondering if we could call so she could tell me about it. We flirted again and she even teased me about potential girls flirting with me on campus. I mentioned how I was a lesbian and she joked “Really? I thought you were straight?”

Does my ex still have feelings with me? I really love her a bunch and would be down to getting back together. However, I want to make sure that I am respecting her decision as I do not want to lose her.

,BreakUps,"A little over a month ago my girlfriend (22F) of 18 months split up with me due to the fact that I lied about several things. I messaged my ex from before we were together in order to find out why she cheated on me, and the once again several months later telling her that there were no hard feelings and having a brief catch up. Furthermore I wasn't a very good partner, I showed her I loved her in many ways but always allowed the big opportunities (birthdays, valentine etc.) pass me by, I was generally irritable and very afraid of dealing with the future.

She rightful broke things off because of these issues on the eve I was leaving the country for a month and it's been rough. She's dealt with things pretty well, despite being very angry and at times quite vengeful we've managed to speak with period of NC and have had a few nice conversations while I was away. As I said we spoke a lot while I was away, mostly because I feel as the offending party that I should be there to own my actions and to provide her with any answers she asks of me. I am however, very hurt and extremely confused by this situation and that tends to come out fairly clearly and often seeps into the conversations, resulting in angriness from her. She has said quite a few times that she misses me and has implied the possibility of reconciliation yet just as often implies the opposite... I am now back and out of quarantine and we are planning to see each other on Sunday.

I'd like to know how you folks would handle this situation? I am still very much in love with her, and hope to illustrate how committed I am to changing by showcasing behavioural changes. The mixed messages have left me very much confused and while I certainly don't want to come across too strong and push her away I cannot allow myself to come to regret my actions during the break up (as I have enough already) and am dedicated to fighting for what I want.

I've been very committed to facilitating a change in me and have finally begun seeing a therapist on a weekly basis. I've done a lot of thinking and tearing down parts of my psyche to understand why I behaved in the way I have and I can safely say I've been having a fairly large breakdown because of everything. Today has been the best I've felt in a long time and that's in part due to a day spent mindfully accepting my emotions as they come and allowing them to leave again on their own. Despite everything that's happened I am hoping for a sort of reconciliation, a hope that we can build a new relationship together on more healthy and equal terms, while knowing full well this might never happen or may happen a long time in the future.

TL;DR: Ex and I split up 1 month ago due my lying. Trying to make things right and seeing her on Sunday, need advice.",t2_5ht3ngjv,False,,0,False,"I (24M) am seeing my ex (22F) on Sunday, one month post break up",[],r/BreakUps,False,6,,0,,False,t3_iii00j,False,dark,1.0,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598686103.0,text,6,,,text,self.BreakUps,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little over a month ago my girlfriend (22F) of 18 months split up with me due to the fact that I lied about several things. I messaged my ex from before we were together in order to find out why she cheated on me, and the once again several months later telling her that there were no hard feelings and having a brief catch up. Furthermore I wasn&amp;#39;t a very good partner, I showed her I loved her in many ways but always allowed the big opportunities (birthdays, valentine etc.) pass me by, I was generally irritable and very afraid of dealing with the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She rightful broke things off because of these issues on the eve I was leaving the country for a month and it&amp;#39;s been rough. She&amp;#39;s dealt with things pretty well, despite being very angry and at times quite vengeful we&amp;#39;ve managed to speak with period of NC and have had a few nice conversations while I was away. As I said we spoke a lot while I was away, mostly because I feel as the offending party that I should be there to own my actions and to provide her with any answers she asks of me. I am however, very hurt and extremely confused by this situation and that tends to come out fairly clearly and often seeps into the conversations, resulting in angriness from her. She has said quite a few times that she misses me and has implied the possibility of reconciliation yet just as often implies the opposite... I am now back and out of quarantine and we are planning to see each other on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to know how you folks would handle this situation? I am still very much in love with her, and hope to illustrate how committed I am to changing by showcasing behavioural changes. The mixed messages have left me very much confused and while I certainly don&amp;#39;t want to come across too strong and push her away I cannot allow myself to come to regret my actions during the break up (as I have enough already) and am dedicated to fighting for what I want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been very committed to facilitating a change in me and have finally begun seeing a therapist on a weekly basis. I&amp;#39;ve done a lot of thinking and tearing down parts of my psyche to understand why I behaved in the way I have and I can safely say I&amp;#39;ve been having a fairly large breakdown because of everything. Today has been the best I&amp;#39;ve felt in a long time and that&amp;#39;s in part due to a day spent mindfully accepting my emotions as they come and allowing them to leave again on their own. Despite everything that&amp;#39;s happened I am hoping for a sort of reconciliation, a hope that we can build a new relationship together on more healthy and equal terms, while knowing full well this might never happen or may happen a long time in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to hearing any advice you may have.&lt;/p&gt;

I didn't feel anything, not one bit of feeling. Then a week went by, I'm living in my parent's fucking dining room on an air mattress, sulking about it. Before I left the apartment she told me that this may just be a break. She still loves me but she feels she needs to experience life without me.

There is so much complex and crazy history between us that, we basically needed a fresh start. She told me this atleast. So, its been about a month since then and we've had very little contact. But I have a feeling that she was jusy saying that because she didn't want to be alone. She was afraid of facing the world alone. I think she actually fell out of love with me and she wants to see new people. I'm literally waiting for the day that she goes and finds a new guy to date. 

Additionally, all my family and friends just want me to move on instantly. They seriously look so fucking annoyed everytime I want to vent about it. So I have to act like I am fine and everyone laughs with me and whatever but I'm fucking broken. I'm so fucking destroyed. You don't just get over an EIGHT year relationship in a fucking month. 

Also, my dad keeps bringing up the past with her and I. He keeps saying stuff like, ""y'know she probably left you because of 'this'"". So now, I am being told how I am not good enough for her which fucks me up.

A few weeks before the break up she was sending me nudes and such.

Then, she wanted to talk to me and say that she needed space but she still wants me with her. She just wants to slow things down a bit more. She told me if I don't like her decision, I can break it up with her. I told her I still wanted to be with her and I already felt her being distant and stuff like that.

A few days go by and I decided to break up with her. I felt as if it was the right move because of how shady she had been. She came over and we talked and I probably cried more than her. I told her that I don't think I can continue this because I feel as if she is being distant and never really told me until she felt overwhelmed. I told her she's an amazing person and I wished her the best in her life. I told her I hope she can find her happiness elsewhere and she said I am amazing and that I deserve the most out of life. She just said I am sorry but I just feel as if I cant be in a relationship because I need to find myself.

I told her if you change your mind and want to be with me, you know how to contact me.

There was no animosity in this breakup.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

David,

I have had breakups that have hurt before. I have had breakups that made me question my worth and confidence. But, our breakup is different. Our breakup has me fluctuating so wildly I’ve lost track of reality. I am so sickeningly willing to be absolutely degraded in return for a shred of affection...my reality is shattered. Was it all my fault?

Last night I was so convinced it was my fault. Obsessively convinced, nothing would pacify me but for you to know that it was me that was wrong and that your feelings and reactions were absolutely justified! But at the same time I was confused, my tears are grief over losing who I was before I met you, too. I didn’t realize it at the time, but I was so proud of myself. I was so high for so long I forgot what the ground felt like. That girl exists in an entirely different world than I am in now. Why am I here? Did I facilitate this? Or did you drag me down? Were you surprised I got so low? Did I get lower than you’ve ever been? My gut says you dragged me, yet I can’t stop feeling conflicted. I’m exhausted.

My mother told me you had signs of narcissism last time we broke up during finals. I didn’t think it was true. She said it again this time we broke up. I still didn’t believe her, but I was intrigued enough to look. Then, I saw you in the majority of the descriptions I found online. You have extremes between grandiose and catastrophe. You became completely irrational when I confronted you, criticized you, or brought up ideas for improvement. You expect compliments all the time. I noticed the need for compliments a long time ago in your relationship with your mother, now it makes sense?

You were obsessed with me when we first met, over the stability and determination I had built for myself, it got worse when you realized I was adamantly unavailable (with a different guy), and then it all spiraled downhill when you figured out ways in anyways and what you could do to weaken my resolve. Why couldn’t you respect me? Why did you constantly break the boundaries I set? You told me you couldn’t stand that thought of not being with me, that you were just so convinced we had something special. In reality, it was because you suffer from narcissism. I told you I didn’t want anything more than friendship for 5 months! For 5 months you tried anyways! 5 months! 5 months! 5 months! You followed me home to SA, even though I told you we were going to be friends, and manipulated me to come see you. AND THEN YOU KISSED ME. TWICE. 5 FUCKING MONTHS YOU DID SHIT LIKE THIS. You knew I was strong. And you were so down on myself. You made me feel bad for this love-sick puppy. So in SA you randomly asked a girl from the apple store on a date. I can’t remember if that was before or after kissing me. Either way…I used to feel bad, he wants me so bad and I’m not being nice by saying no, because look what he has resorted to! Now I understand it was you using me, and that girl, to feel better. I sympathize, its an existential experience, we have all probably unfairly used someone a few times before. BUT FOR 5 MONTHS YOU DID THIS TO ME. WHY ME. WHY COULDN’T YOU LEAVE ME ALONE WILE I WAS HAPPY.

We had the greatest honeymoon phase. And the greatest crash I’ve ever seen. Admit it, you pushed me to say I love you. You pretended to ‘accidentally’ say it in your sleep when I was awake to hear. I thought it was cute that you were lying, so I let you. You thought I didn’t see the lie. I did see it, but I misinterpreted your intentions. Yet another sign of your narcissism and manipulation, because once I said it, once I showered you with it, you started acting different. I was so confused. This is what you ‘fought’ so hard for? Did I fail so miserably? So irrevocably so you now can’t stand another day with me?

Everything- people, pets, situations, your self-worth, were either amazing or the worst thing ever. Oh man did it freak me out when you got down on yourself. I have never seen someone so consistently, systematically, irrational talk bad about themselves. You talked to me about contemplating suicide twice in 6 months. It affected me more than I realized. I cared about you. I told you it wasn’t normal, healthy.

All of our disagreements, no matter how big or small, had to be entirely one person’s fault or the other. I pointed this out to you constructively and you refused to acknowledge that too, obviously. A small disagreement rarely stayed small. Because when I voiced a concern, your immediate reaction was to literally say ‘its not my fault’ or ‘I did nothing wrong’ or say something so wildly inaccurate and inflammatory, I lost my cool. Then it was my fault, because I yelled while your manipulation was still quiet and subtle. Then you told I was making you feel like you were ‘walking on eggshells’. I let you convince me! My concerns were too numerous, too insignificant to justify the drama! Every time we argued, you told me you ‘did nothing wrong’. My gut told me otherwise. Sometimes it was obviously something you did. When this first started happening, I was confused. You promised to not see Nayeli (his client) in person, but then I ‘caught’ you admitting you just saw her? I thought you understood the gravity of the pandemic, and later, the risk it posed to my ability to continue with school if either one of us fail to social distance? I cared so much about school, I was hurt that you didn’t care about my cares, but allowed myself to be convinced the concern was too much to ask of anyone. I hated being the ‘bad cop’ and calling you out. I hated myself when I contemplated if I really was the one to blame for making you walk on egg shells. I wanted nothing more than for the promises you used to pacify me, our compromises, my willingness to apologize and eagerness to find a systematic way to deal with our arguments, to be the steadfast rules we stuck to, unless we felt we needed to reevaluate. I let you convince me all of our arguments were the result of me trying to control you. I knew in the beginning I was just asking for respect, but by the end I’m still deciding if I’m toxically controlling. How did I let myself get here? No one has ever described me as controlling, but maybe it was there all along?

You were unfaithful by stealing and storing pictures of other women online without their permission while we were dating. You promised you wanted to work on it. You broke that promise when you did it again 2 mo later and didn’t follow up on our plan to go to church together (he's christian, I'm atheist that wanted to give it another shot with him). Worse than me giving you a third chance, is the fact that you spent all of your emotional energy those next few weeks justifying it! Its what men do! Its your freedom! You and your friends do it and its fine! Am I wrong to think, if I were caught doing that, my first reaction would be to apologize, ask for forgiveness, look for a solution…therefore that’s what you should’ve done? I pointed out that faithful relationships are what Christianity advocates. You saw that logic, couldn’t handle the hypocrisy of your habits, so you started looking for something I did wrong. You looked through my phone and saw texts of my classmate flirting with me. You and I aren’t getting back together, I have no more ego, no more will power or strength, nothing to lose, but I am still SO adamant that my responses were intended to be neutral, to mitigate his advances, to respect our relationship. I can understand how that in of itself is contradictory to my steadfast desire for faithfulness. I could’ve not replied at all. But the difference between us is that I was mitigating a situation, I have to work with him. You went and looked for those women, you sought out and created situations of unfaithfulness! You were so excited to have found a more tangible hypocrisy in me. It was your goal to find a fault in me, to feel better about yourself, and you accomplished that goal. You tried to convince me I was unfaithful, that what I did was no different. But you’ve never been able to out logic me when we argue because I argue with logic and you only argue to maintain your fragile self-worth. You were always better at inflaming the situation though, you were so masterful in getting me irrationally heated. You knew what to say to make me so made I broke shit. You liked seeing me mess up. It made you feel better to see me come down to your level. I pushed you with my hands and now there was no denying I was treating you bad.

So we broke up. But that did the trick and your tactic worked! You’re right I am a terrible, unfaithful person! So I ran back to you that night and begged you for 5 hours to take me back. I would do better by you! I promise! It didn’t work and we fell asleep. We woke up and I begged you again for a few more hours! Up until 15 min before my final. Oh god, I can’t believe I spent the night and morning before my final begging you to forgive me. School used to be completely uncompromisable. Who have I become? Did you make me this way? Or have I always been this way?

Wow, this letter has helped. I see now that you made me feel so bad about myself, convinced me I was treating you so badly on my own accord that I couldn’t to confide in anyone. I thought they were deep hidden traits in me. But I’ve never displayed them in other relationships! Wow. FUCKING WOW. I felt I couldn’t talk to anyone because I was afraid of having those fears that I am a bad person confirmed. I absolutely couldn’t tell anyone how terrible I am, how I got so mad I smashed my phone, I got so mad I pushed you for saying I was cheating. I was mad because my gut said I was doing the right things, but my mind was your’s, and my mind was saying I was doing the wrong things. YOU ISOLATED ME. I know that if you were hearing this in person you’d laugh at that. There’s absolutely no way you’d do that, no way I could find evidence of such, how you want nothing more than for me to finally go hangout with someone else so I could finally give you your space. You told me to talk to my mom. ‘For the love of God go talk to your mother’. BUT YOU KNEW I COULDN’T TELL HER. I couldn’t face her hypothetical judgment and admit what I’d been doing because that’s exactly how you operate. Your mother thinks you could do no wrong. And you can’t have that bubble burst. You flip at the idea of her knowing what you do to women. You don’t understand it consciously, but subconsciously you know its awful what you do, so you don’t tell her. She would still love you David. I still loved you.

I was addicted to you, reliant on you to reaffirm I was worth love. That’s how I fell from being so high. You convinced me to climb down from the platform I had built up for years. That’s why I’m so conflicted. Because you drugged me, took my mind away from me, then pointed out I walked on down with my own two feet.

Last night I was so convinced it was my fault. Obsessively convinced, nothing would pacify me but for you to know that it was me that was wrong and that your feelings and reactions were absolutely justified! But you gaslighted me yet again. I’m stupid for expecting different. When I asked for help last night, you said you care, you’d help, you’d call, there’s nothing to forgive. And then you never called. When you showed me your desperation, I dropped absolutely everything in my life, for 9 months now. 9 months of ruin in the hopes that I could help you feel better, with me. If you felt better, it would’ve been worth it. Last night I showed you I was desperate, and you looked away.",t2_7w0f4b4k,False,,0,False,I'm [28F] coming to terms with the end of a toxic relationship [9 months].

But at the same time I was confused, my tears are grief over losing who I was before I met you, too. I didn’t realize it at the time, but I was so proud of myself. I was so high for so long I forgot what the ground felt like. That girl exists in an entirely different world than I am in now. Why am I here? Did I facilitate this? Or did you drag me down? Were you surprised I got so low? Did I get lower than you’ve ever been? My gut says you dragged me, yet I can’t stop feeling conflicted. I’m exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mother told me you had signs of narcissism last time we broke up during finals. I didn’t think it was true. She said it again this time we broke up. I still didn’t believe her, but I was intrigued enough to look. Then, I saw you in the majority of the descriptions I found online. You have extremes between grandiose and catastrophe. You became completely irrational when I confronted you, criticized you, or brought up ideas for improvement. You expect compliments all the time. I noticed the need for compliments a long time ago in your relationship with your mother, now it makes sense?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You were obsessed with me when we first met, over the stability and determination I had built for myself, it got worse when you realized I was adamantly unavailable (with a different guy), and then it all spiraled downhill when you figured out ways in anyways and what you could do to weaken my resolve. Why couldn’t you respect me? Why did you constantly break the boundaries I set? You told me you couldn’t stand that thought of not being with me, that you were just so convinced we had something special. In reality, it was because you suffer from narcissism. I told you I didn’t want anything more than friendship for 5 months! For 5 months you tried anyways! 5 months! 5 months! 5 months! You followed me home to SA, even though I told you we were going to be friends, and manipulated me to come see you. AND THEN YOU KISSED ME. TWICE. 5 FUCKING MONTHS YOU DID SHIT LIKE THIS. You knew I was strong. And you were so down on myself. You made me feel bad for this love-sick puppy. So in SA you randomly asked a girl from the apple store on a date. I can’t remember if that was before or after kissing me. Either way…I used to feel bad, he wants me so bad and I’m not being nice by saying no, because look what he has resorted to! Now I understand it was you using me, and that girl, to feel better. I sympathize, its an existential experience, we have all probably unfairly used someone a few times before. BUT FOR 5 MONTHS YOU DID THIS TO ME. WHY ME. WHY COULDN’T YOU LEAVE ME ALONE WILE I WAS HAPPY.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had the greatest honeymoon phase. And the greatest crash I’ve ever seen. Admit it, you pushed me to say I love you. You pretended to ‘accidentally’ say it in your sleep when I was awake to hear. I thought it was cute that you were lying, so I let you. You thought I didn’t see the lie. I did see it, but I misinterpreted your intentions. Yet another sign of your narcissism and manipulation, because once I said it, once I showered you with it, you started acting different. I was so confused. This is what you ‘fought’ so hard for? Did I fail so miserably? So irrevocably so you now can’t stand another day with me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything- people, pets, situations, your self-worth, were either amazing or the worst thing ever. Oh man did it freak me out when you got down on yourself. I have never seen someone so consistently, systematically, irrational talk bad about themselves. You talked to me about contemplating suicide twice in 6 months. It affected me more than I realized. I cared about you. I told you it wasn’t normal, healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of our disagreements, no matter how big or small, had to be entirely one person’s fault or the other. I pointed this out to you constructively and you refused to acknowledge that too, obviously. A small disagreement rarely stayed small. Because when I voiced a concern, your immediate reaction was to literally say ‘its not my fault’ or ‘I did nothing wrong’ or say something so wildly inaccurate and inflammatory, I lost my cool. Then it was my fault, because I yelled while your manipulation was still quiet and subtle. Then you told I was making you feel like you were ‘walking on eggshells’. I let you convince me! My concerns were too numerous, too insignificant to justify the drama! Every time we argued, you told me you ‘did nothing wrong’. My gut told me otherwise. Sometimes it was obviously something you did. When this first started happening, I was confused. You promised to not see Nayeli (his client) in person, but then I ‘caught’ you admitting you just saw her? I thought you understood the gravity of the pandemic, and later, the risk it posed to my ability to continue with school if either one of us fail to social distance? I cared so much about school, I was hurt that you didn’t care about my cares, but allowed myself to be convinced the concern was too much to ask of anyone. I hated being the ‘bad cop’ and calling you out. I hated myself when I contemplated if I really was the one to blame for making you walk on egg shells. I wanted nothing more than for the promises you used to pacify me, our compromises, my willingness to apologize and eagerness to find a systematic way to deal with our arguments, to be the steadfast rules we stuck to, unless we felt we needed to reevaluate. I let you convince me all of our arguments were the result of me trying to control you. I knew in the beginning I was just asking for respect, but by the end I’m still deciding if I’m toxically controlling. How did I let myself get here? No one has ever described me as controlling, but maybe it was there all along?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You were unfaithful by stealing and storing pictures of other women online without their permission while we were dating. You promised you wanted to work on it. You broke that promise when you did it again 2 mo later and didn’t follow up on our plan to go to church together (he&amp;#39;s christian, I&amp;#39;m atheist that wanted to give it another shot with him). Worse than me giving you a third chance, is the fact that you spent all of your emotional energy those next few weeks justifying it! Its what men do! Its your freedom! You and your friends do it and its fine! Am I wrong to think, if I were caught doing that, my first reaction would be to apologize, ask for forgiveness, look for a solution…therefore that’s what you should’ve done? I pointed out that faithful relationships are what Christianity advocates. You saw that logic, couldn’t handle the hypocrisy of your habits, so you started looking for something I did wrong. You looked through my phone and saw texts of my classmate flirting with me. You and I aren’t getting back together, I have no more ego, no more will power or strength, nothing to lose, but I am still SO adamant that my responses were intended to be neutral, to mitigate his advances, to respect our relationship. I can understand how that in of itself is contradictory to my steadfast desire for faithfulness. I could’ve not replied at all. But the difference between us is that I was mitigating a situation, I have to work with him. You went and looked for those women, you sought out and created situations of unfaithfulness! You were so excited to have found a more tangible hypocrisy in me. It was your goal to find a fault in me, to feel better about yourself, and you accomplished that goal. You tried to convince me I was unfaithful, that what I did was no different. But you’ve never been able to out logic me when we argue because I argue with logic and you only argue to maintain your fragile self-worth. You were always better at inflaming the situation though, you were so masterful in getting me irrationally heated. You knew what to say to make me so made I broke shit. You liked seeing me mess up. It made you feel better to see me come down to your level. I pushed you with my hands and now there was no denying I was treating you bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we broke up. But that did the trick and your tactic worked! You’re right I am a terrible, unfaithful person! So I ran back to you that night and begged you for 5 hours to take me back. I would do better by you! I promise! It didn’t work and we fell asleep. We woke up and I begged you again for a few more hours! Up until 15 min before my final. Oh god, I can’t believe I spent the night and morning before my final begging you to forgive me. School used to be completely uncompromisable. Who have I become? Did you make me this way? Or have I always been this way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, this letter has helped. I see now that you made me feel so bad about myself, convinced me I was treating you so badly on my own accord that I couldn’t to confide in anyone. I thought they were deep hidden traits in me. But I’ve never displayed them in other relationships! Wow. FUCKING WOW. I felt I couldn’t talk to anyone because I was afraid of having those fears that I am a bad person confirmed. I absolutely couldn’t tell anyone how terrible I am, how I got so mad I smashed my phone, I got so mad I pushed you for saying I was cheating. I was mad because my gut said I was doing the right things, but my mind was your’s, and my mind was saying I was doing the wrong things. YOU ISOLATED ME. I know that if you were hearing this in person you’d laugh at that. There’s absolutely no way you’d do that, no way I could find evidence of such, how you want nothing more than for me to finally go hangout with someone else so I could finally give you your space. You told me to talk to my mom. ‘For the love of God go talk to your mother’. BUT YOU KNEW I COULDN’T TELL HER. I couldn’t face her hypothetical judgment and admit what I’d been doing because that’s exactly how you operate. Your mother thinks you could do no wrong. And you can’t have that bubble burst. You flip at the idea of her knowing what you do to women. You don’t understand it consciously, but subconsciously you know its awful what you do, so you don’t tell her. She would still love you David. I still loved you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was addicted to you, reliant on you to reaffirm I was worth love. That’s how I fell from being so high. You convinced me to climb down from the platform I had built up for years. That’s why I’m so conflicted. Because you drugged me, took my mind away from me, then pointed out I walked on down with my own two feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night I was so convinced it was my fault. Obsessively convinced, nothing would pacify me but for you to know that it was me that was wrong and that your feelings and reactions were absolutely justified! But you gaslighted me yet again. I’m stupid for expecting different. When I asked for help last night, you said you care, you’d help, you’d call, there’s nothing to forgive. And then you never called. When you showed me your desperation, I dropped absolutely everything in my life, for 9 months now. 9 months of ruin in the hopes that I could help you feel better, with me. If you felt better, it would’ve been worth it. Last night I showed you I was desperate, and you looked away.&lt;/p&gt;

,BreakUps,"hiya alligator, 

you are still my first thought when i wake up. i feel all warm and full and then i remember that you’re no longer there and i feel scooped out.  everything that was there is replaced with this sinking, empty feeling. all i could ask for is to feel loved by you again. which i know sounds pathetic or whatever it sounds like, but it’s true. you made me happy and you made me feel loved even when you moved miles away. 
all day i think of you. all day i wonder if you think of me or if i ever even cross your mind. i wonder if you see something you like and instantly want to show me, and just as instantly feel that tight feeling in your throat. do you wake up in the morning waiting to hear from me? do you open our texts wanting to say you love me?

i really want to hate you for leaving. for taking the easy way out. for giving up so soon. but i just hate myself instead because i can’t hate you. you even told me that you’d always fight for me. you were the first person to ever say that to me. what happened? what went wrong? you fought to keep me before, scared of losing me, why not now? we both knew it would be hard, but what made you realize you didn’t want to try? i was happy with what i had. why couldn’t you have been happy with me? 

i just want to know if you loved me the way i love you. i want to wholeheartedly believe you did or still do. i saw the way you looked at me. the way you held me. kissed me. talked with me. how many times did you comfort me while i cried over stupid things and made me feel understood and heard. if that wasnt love you’re either an amazing actor or i’m an amazing idiot. 

i sit here and wonder what it will be like the next time i see you. if i’ll see your eyes light up like they used to when i walked in the room, or if you’ll just offer me a greeting you’d give to anyone you pass by. will i feel that feeling i felt looking at you from afar and wishing it could be different? 

i don’t know what purpose you are meant to serve in my life. you did so much for me. you were the reason i left that “home” even if i didn’t leave for you. why was i so drawn to you? why did i drive home missing you, without knowing you. why once i started to get to know you, it felt like we had been together for years. what purpose did i have in your life? what was i good for? 

somebody told me that you can’t rely on just love to make a relationship work, but we had more than that, didnt we? 

i listened to that song, you know the one, and i realized i was smiling, despite being so sad. that’s what you do to me, you just give me one simple reason to smile. but i’ve never heard a song so perfectly fit any situation better. from getting lost in someone’s eyes to someone slipping away. it’s bittersweet. when i listen to it my heart feels the way it felt for you in the very beginning, but then i realize i can’t just send you a quick text to remind you that i love you. 

i miss your face like hell and i’ve missed being with you for even longer, but nothing compares to just knowing you’re gone and knowing that i’ll never hear you call me sunshine ever again. it just doesn’t sound the same from other people. 

i know the distance is fucking awful, especially because you’re somebody i actually want to spend every little moment with. i’m sad i’m going to miss so much - even from far away i was still a part of it. i am in love with a you that in a month won’t exist, and the saddest part of it is that i won’t be able to watch you transform and change. the you i love will just be gone and the you you’ll become i won’t know. 

i don’t know what i’m trying to do here. all i know is that i want you to be happy. i wish you and i could be happy together. i wish when i woke up i still had notifications from you. i wish that when life got to be a little too much for a moment, i still had you to talk to. i wish i still got phone calls when you got drunk. i wish it didn’t hurt to hear people say your name. but wishing doesn’t do anything and writing a book to you won’t either. 

you’re going to be hard to let go of, and i don’t think i ever fully will. and even if you’re sitting there laughing at all this, i really don’t mind. i just wanted to one last time remind you that you were always good at making me smile, and sometimes when i think of you these days, i still do. i’ll probably look for you in everyone i meet. 

i love you in the truest, honest, most stupidest way possible. you made me the happiest girl in the world. 

live hard, but always always always love and allow yourself to be loved harder.

,BreakUps,"I don’t know who to talk to, so I’m here.

Long story short, my ex and I were together 5.5 years and engaged. We found out in January we were expecting our first child. He just started with a union and was making $33 an hour and I was making good money at my job as well. This was the best news ever for us, because 3 months into our relationship we had an abortion due to the age difference (we are 5 years apart and I was 26 and he was freshly 22 at the time) and me feeling I didn’t know him quite well enough yet - among other reasons like not being financially secure yet, etc. Then he stole money from our savings a month later...started getting very distant from me as well, and started drinking behind my back. COVID didn’t help, and I was laid off from my job until my maternity leave ends (end of October/early November depending on when I give birth, I’m due September 19th). Then he started watching porn for the first time in years. Quit being affectionate and having sex with me. Refused to rub my back once baby got bigger and heavier to carry around. It was really hard watching the man I spent 5 years with change so drastically and so horribly while I was pregnant with his child. I was confused and hurt and whenever I’d let him know that, I’d get screamed at.

The night before 4th of July I was very sick with a summer cold. I took a long shower to keep myself in the steam. Got out and he was absolutely trashed...he was sober when I got into the shower an hour before. We had an argument and he left, after charging at me and threatening to hit me and even calling me names (he’s never done that before). He drove the new car we got in March for our baby to Idaho, where his toxic family lives - DRUNK. And he never came back, and never contacted me. All this, while I was 29 weeks pregnant. I’ll be 37 weeks tomorrow. He left his phone behind.

My parents ended up having to rent a truck and towing equipment to drive from Oregon, to Washington (where my dad lives, mom and I live in Oregon), to Idaho to retrieve the car. Ex was in touch with my mom just barely enough to let her know the car wasn’t running and where to find it. My mom convinced me to go to talk to him if we see him. He sees me, starts weeping, then tells me it’s over. I told him he can’t just walk away and give up, we have a baby due in a month and she deserves a shot at her parents giving her a family. He holds my hand and tells me he can’t go home with me and must do it “on his own time.” I give him his phone to keep in touch, and I was a fool for that. Instead of keeping in touch and discussing what we were going to do, he used it to sit on Instagram all day drooling over Instagram models and porn stars and talk to his friends. My texts and calls went ignored. I also gave him our credit card to use to pay his union dues and get himself home when he’s ready. He ends up not calling his union (which tells me he doesn’t plan on coming back to Oregon and left behind a high paying job) and instead uses it to buy someone $25 in gas. I text him letting him know I know all of this and he tells me I’m a hateful negative person and that’s why he left, and that he’s going to be a father to our daughter whether I like it or not...even though he’s living in Idaho now with his dysfunctional family, has no job, no car, his license is going to be suspended soon since he left the state without paying a traffic ticket he had court for the DAY BEFORE HE LEFT. He has nothing to help himself care for a newborn and honestly has nothing to take care of himself either. I don’t know how exactly he planned/plans on being a father when he has nothing to contribute to his daughter’s life and willingly and knowingly gave everything up just to spite me.

Since the phone is under my name on my Verizon account, I had it shut off on Sunday. I then blocked all his family’s phone numbers so they couldn’t contact me for him. Them and all his friends have been removed or blocked from my social media since he left. I haven’t talked to him since and I don’t plan on finding a way to. 

To say I’m shocked is an understatement. I have had the worst pregnancy imaginable and I don’t even blame COVID - I blame my ex. I’m deeply hurt and it may sound awful but knowing I’m pregnant with his child really hurts me and I’m dreading her being born because I’m so scared she’s going to constantly make me think of her father and that I’ll feel even worse than I do now. 

I guess I’m just posting this to vent and see what others think of my situation. It was long so thanks if you made it this far.

,BreakUps,"It has been two weeks since my separation. I have been through a lot since the pandemic started. I lost everything that was important to me in such a short time and it was out of my control. I carry around a lot of guilt and I am finding myself in a situation I don’t want to be. Days pass by and I am in this complete darkness, like I am not present in my own life and I just live in my head, obsessing over this separation. I’m wondering what he is doing miles away, I imagine him doing great and not even caring that he has lost me and our marriage if I can even call it that. I am in therapy because I thought I needed it and that it will make me feel better, but nothing makes me feel better and I am trying to find something that will at least let me breathe for a second without feeling this horrible pain that I am feeling 24/7, all the time. I hate the fact that I still carry the hope that one day soon, my still husband will contact me, realizing what his mistakes were and that what I’ve been trying to tell him all this time will finally get through his head.
This year, I spent the NYE at home with my husband (I haven’t stayed at home since I was a child and I always make NYE a big deal) and it was one of the best nights of my life. I had everything and I had someone I trusted 100% by my side who seemed like the most loving, caring, kindest guy I ever met. But as the months went by, I lost my dream job due to COVID-19, my then husband was not supportive of me going through this and ever since we got married he changed to this disrespectful, holding back affection from me intentionally- saying I don’t deserve it, confessed to a STD (that still affects me today) a week after our wedding and then blamed me for snapping at him because he didn’t think this was a big deal. Then two weeks into our marriage, he told me that I am the last woman he will be nice to and that in the future when he will eventually meet someone else (five years from now) and get married again he will not be this nice and taken advantage of or something like that... To me that was a turning point and although I didn’t end things then ( I just couldn’t imagine him getting on a plane and leave where I won’t ever see or talk to him ever again) I became very insecure. While just two weeks prior he would tell me how we will grow old together that I am everything he ever wanted in a S/O and that he wouldn’t change anything about me, that he will love me no matter what and he will never give up on us, that he is so happy that he got to marry the woman of his dreams. And he even told this to everyone he knew...
But then things went to hell and I don’t know why. He badmouthed me to everyone so much so that his parents didn’t even wish me a happy birthday. And two days prior to my birthday he told me he can’t stand me, that probably everyone I ever went out with dumped me for being so hard to be around. And this came right after I showed him a nasty photo someone send to me and said that maybe that person should get a life. Things that before we would share with each other and laugh about. It was just out of nowhere to me.
During the past six months and the same amount of time we were married he seems to be distancing himself from our relationship, imagining himself leaving and how he will cope with the fact- by going to the gym and getting tattoos as if life will somehow be great for him if he did all that on his own not realizing that what he has with me was really precious and comes so rarely in someone’s life. He then would try to convince me that he wants to work on things and repair all the mistakes that kept happening, that he kept making. But he never did. He would randomly do something nice for me and when I seem appreciative he would suddenly start a fight and ruin everything, every hope that I had we could turn things around because god help me, I really wanted to. I still do, I still hope that he will come to his senses and somehow make this into what it was supposed to be, that some couples really need to hit rock bottom before everything gets better, before they realize the loss.
For the past year since we lived together he has done nothing for us to stay together. You see he is from another country and needed to apply for work permits and resident card here to be able to create a life. We had plans to do so and I got married so fast because I wanted to offer him the opportunity to have a chance in making a life here with me like he said he really wanted, and so we can be together and I kept my end of the bargain- while everytime we fought after we got married it made me think that the reason he’s not actually leaving is because of not having where to go- no house, no job, nothing. Because he had everything here- comfort, a house, support, unconditional love, to name a few for him to start a new life with me away from his poor past- yet he chose to hurt me and keep secrets and lie about who he was or who he keeps in contact with and why. He lead me on for months- saying he doesn’t want a life with me, yet everytime I tried to file for divorce he tried to convince me that we are meant to be and that he will change, he will do whatever it takes to stay by my side, that we will accomplish the dreams and plans we made. But instead of following through with it, he would tell me that we are not a good match, that we fight a lot and he doesn’t want anything serious (like how serious- we are married!!!!!!). Just these crazy fights.
I made mistakes as well, just like any human. I just can’t keep apologizing for the same things over and over, I can’t change the past and heck, if he didn’t like it or somehow it was a big deal- why marry me? You know. I feel used and manipulated, and cannot believe that the person he used to be up until we got married doesn’t exist. I loved that person with all my heart and went into this 100% and for what?
I ended up in the hospital for the STD he gave me. I am depressed and have been for the past 6 months. I cannot function and I am just lost and hurting like I never hurt before. I don’t think or see any joy in my future. I don’t think I can ever meet someone else and I hate that he has so much power over me. I don’t think he deserved the life I gave him while he was with me and now I see his profile photos changing to places he went with me and only visited because of me, like he is proud of having taken advantage of me. And I feel worthless, like really? Was there nothing lovable about me? Like is this what I deserve? Is this what I get for having dreams about sharing my life with someone and celebrate that? I was looking forward to us travelling the world and share all these memories, having a house together and decorate it as we wanted to, start a family. Like what else is more important and precious in this lifetime than this? Than having someone who loves you unconditionally and forgives you and tries to better your life in every way? Like really? I have no value for offering those things? Do these things not matter anymore? I am now single and I don’t want to be, I wanted to go on a road trip but what’s the point of going alone and heart broken. His birthday was just a few days ago and I had so many surprises planned for him. Everything happened so fast and I just feel scammed and abandoned and I just don’t understand why.

To me that was a turning point and although I didn’t end things then ( I just couldn’t imagine him getting on a plane and leave where I won’t ever see or talk to him ever again) I became very insecure. While just two weeks prior he would tell me how we will grow old together that I am everything he ever wanted in a S/O and that he wouldn’t change anything about me, that he will love me no matter what and he will never give up on us, that he is so happy that he got to marry the woman of his dreams. And he even told this to everyone he knew...
But then things went to hell and I don’t know why. He badmouthed me to everyone so much so that his parents didn’t even wish me a happy birthday. And two days prior to my birthday he told me he can’t stand me, that probably everyone I ever went out with dumped me for being so hard to be around. And this came right after I showed him a nasty photo someone send to me and said that maybe that person should get a life. Things that before we would share with each other and laugh about. It was just out of nowhere to me.
During the past six months and the same amount of time we were married he seems to be distancing himself from our relationship, imagining himself leaving and how he will cope with the fact- by going to the gym and getting tattoos as if life will somehow be great for him if he did all that on his own not realizing that what he has with me was really precious and comes so rarely in someone’s life. He then would try to convince me that he wants to work on things and repair all the mistakes that kept happening, that he kept making. But he never did. He would randomly do something nice for me and when I seem appreciative he would suddenly start a fight and ruin everything, every hope that I had we could turn things around because god help me, I really wanted to. I still do, I still hope that he will come to his senses and somehow make this into what it was supposed to be, that some couples really need to hit rock bottom before everything gets better, before they realize the loss.
For the past year since we lived together he has done nothing for us to stay together. You see he is from another country and needed to apply for work permits and resident card here to be able to create a life. We had plans to do so and I got married so fast because I wanted to offer him the opportunity to have a chance in making a life here with me like he said he really wanted, and so we can be together and I kept my end of the bargain- while everytime we fought after we got married it made me think that the reason he’s not actually leaving is because of not having where to go- no house, no job, nothing. Because he had everything here- comfort, a house, support, unconditional love, to name a few for him to start a new life with me away from his poor past- yet he chose to hurt me and keep secrets and lie about who he was or who he keeps in contact with and why. He lead me on for months- saying he doesn’t want a life with me, yet everytime I tried to file for divorce he tried to convince me that we are meant to be and that he will change, he will do whatever it takes to stay by my side, that we will accomplish the dreams and plans we made. But instead of following through with it, he would tell me that we are not a good match, that we fight a lot and he doesn’t want anything serious (like how serious- we are married!!!!!!). Just these crazy fights.
I made mistakes as well, just like any human. I just can’t keep apologizing for the same things over and over, I can’t change the past and heck, if he didn’t like it or somehow it was a big deal- why marry me? You know. I feel used and manipulated, and cannot believe that the person he used to be up until we got married doesn’t exist. I loved that person with all my heart and went into this 100% and for what?
I ended up in the hospital for the STD he gave me. I am depressed and have been for the past 6 months. I cannot function and I am just lost and hurting like I never hurt before. I don’t think or see any joy in my future. I don’t think I can ever meet someone else and I hate that he has so much power over me. I don’t think he deserved the life I gave him while he was with me and now I see his profile photos changing to places he went with me and only visited because of me, like he is proud of having taken advantage of me. And I feel worthless, like really? Was there nothing lovable about me? Like is this what I deserve? Is this what I get for having dreams about sharing my life with someone and celebrate that? I was looking forward to us travelling the world and share all these memories, having a house together and decorate it as we wanted to, start a family. Like what else is more important and precious in this lifetime than this? Than having someone who loves you unconditionally and forgives you and tries to better your life in every way? Like really? I have no value for offering those things? Do these things not matter anymore? I am now single and I don’t want to be, I wanted to go on a road trip but what’s the point of going alone and heart broken. His birthday was just a few days ago and I had so many surprises planned for him. Everything happened so fast and I just feel scammed and abandoned and I just don’t understand why. And I wish in my heart of hearts that the day when he will realize what he has lost will come and that he will regret it and feel loss for the rest of his life.&lt;/p&gt;

,BreakUps,"Hey y'all. Longtime lurker, first-time poster. Actually, first post on Reddit now that I think about it.

I don't want to get into all the details of my breakup. It was...strangely specific and don't want to get too personal. The important detail to know is that I was betrayed. She didn't cheat, no, but I trusted her and it was violated definitely by her family, most likely by her as well. The issue in question happened a significant portion of time after we broke up, and the breakup itself was as amicable as it gets (""I love yous"" were still said, compliments were exchanged, praise was given, that sort of thing).

Now I'm usually a pretty mellow guy. I make an effort to be at peace with everyone. I try to fix problems that come up instead of run away from them. If I did something to hurt someone out of ignorance or weakness, that's my bad, and I'll move mountains to make amends. I never try to hurt people intentionally; there's too much hurt in this world as it is. It's infinitely harder to hold a grudge than it is to make peace, even if I still don't end up spending time or even talking to the other person afterward, at least in my case. If I'm unable to make peace, then usually I just let it go, be the ""bigger person"" (I truly hate that term, but for lack of a better one), let time pass, and move on. That being said, I'm not a doormat, and won't tolerate obvious/intentionally malicious behavior and will happily call people out on it.

The problem is, after what happened with the ol' Ex-GF and Co., I flip between white-hot, boiling rage and deep, resounding despair. I've been doing a lot of CBT (thanks Dr. Mike) which helps in the moment, but I won't lie, I feel closer to the edge than I care to be. Usually when the memories, the ire, or the sadness hit, I workout. I've been working out since I was a teenager (24 now) and I'm in pretty good shape. About a week ago, though, I took a pedal to the calf while biking and ended up with a 3/4in deep gouge in my leg, so 80% of my workouts are impossible and the other 20% hurt something fierce.

So for five days I've been stewing in my own vitriol, unable to productively vent, and you know what they say about idle hands. It's taking a great deal of self-control to not jump back into old, not-so-good habits, stalk social medias, do the things I know would be dangerous to my own pursuit of happiness.

Why is it so hard to let this go? It's been doggone near five months at this point. I'm exhausted of feeling this way, I'm tired of being livid with someone I used to love, at people I used to consider family. I don't know how to accept being the villain of someone else's story, especially when no villainy took place. It's hurting my sleep, it's hurting my waking hours, there's not a moment that goes by where I truly feel like myself. This hurts worse than when I was *actually* cheated on years ago. I'm beginning to wonder whether the pursuit of romance is worth the risk of heartache. You can do everything right and still end up with a blade in the back, right to the heart.

I don't know exactly why I posted my story. I'm not sure exactly what I'm looking for (besides maybe a good way to pass the time and occupy the mind.

,BreakUps,"So, this is my first post on Reddit, sucks that it's a downer. 

My first relationship (a little over 1.5 years long) is fully ending this weekend, he's finally moving out on Sunday. At the end of July he learned that he's going to have to move across the country for work and asked if I would go with him. I told him I would only go if he could tell me that he knows for sure that I'm the one he want to spend the rest of his life with, but he couldn't do it. He says that he loves me, that I'm his favorite person, but he just worries about the ""What if?"" The ""what if"" of a different woman out there. I can't find the words to describe the hurt. 

He doesn't have to move for work until later in the year, and that he ""wants me for as long as he can have me,"" and I thought I could let him stay, but I quickly realized that it hurts too much. Being with him everyday, acting like things are normal, but knowing there's a timeline and that he doesn't want me like I want him, it's too much. So I told him he needs to move out. I'm not going to be his ""good enough for right now."" I am worth more than that.

I'm telling myself that it's for the best, that I need to move on and do what's right for me. I love the relationship that we had and I wouldn't change it for anything, but it's over now and I'm working to accept that. It's going to be really hard once he's fully gone, but it's the only way I'll be able to move forward.

&lt;p&gt;At week 3 I threw everything away. But I then had like loads of empty frames. That had been full of lovely photos of us.
Anyway this week I went online and bought loads of lovely postcard prints from red bubble and Etsy. Some excellent artwork on there and the postcards are cheap. I put them all up today and my life felt brighter :)&lt;/p&gt;

,BreakUps,"Hey,

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 17-year old girl, who recently broke up with my now ex-boyfriend. We were together for 2,5 years, we broke up 2-3 weeks ago.

I am doing my best to focus on myself, but it is hard. We go to the same school, and we have all of the same classes together. It is impossible to avoid him, and I even work with him on some projects. 

It also hurts to see him talking to other girls. It is not because he talks with this specific girl during his spare time, but they work together on a project. I am so scared that they'll fall in love and I then will have to see them being together for the rest of the school year.

&lt;p&gt;It also hurts to see him talking to other girls. It is not because he talks with this specific girl during his spare time, but they work together on a project. I am so scared that they&amp;#39;ll fall in love and I then will have to see them being together for the rest of the school year.&lt;/p&gt;

\--

I wish I had just let things be.

Last August, my girlfriend dumped me unexpectedly, just a couple of days before we were set to move onto our respective campuses for the start of our Junior year. That was one of the challenges of our relationship; because we are both full time students that go to different colleges in different states, our relationship transitioned from a physical, in person one to a long distance relationship for about 8 months out of the year. It certainly presented unique challenges, but we had done it with no issues for the previous 2 years, and I figured that year would be the same.

She confessed to me that the distance, even though it was temporary, had become too much for her. I agree it was hard, but I couldn't understand why she'd want to throw our entire relationship away over it. I tried to dig deeper and kept asking if there was any other reason she was feeling this way, but she insisted it was the distance alone. It started off as ""taking a break"" and ""seeing how we feel after a bit and going from there"". After spending about a week in that weird stage, she formally ended things.

Up until that point, I had been with her for just shy of 4 years. There wasn't a doubt in my mind that this was the woman I wanted to marry, start a family with, and spend the rest of my life with. But she had become so cold and unapproachable overnight, she was completely unrecognizable.

To say it was hard would be an understatement. It damn near killed me. I couldn't sleep. I couldn't eat. Most days I wanted to do nothing except lie in bed all day and cry. My grades plummeted and my friendships deteriorated as a result. I kept trying to find solace in her, but to no avail. Anytime I tried to talk to her about things, she indicated that she needed space. I tried to respect her wishes, but it was so hard to go through this alone. It took her threatening to block me on everything to prompt No Contact. I reluctantly agreed; not for my own sake and healing, but to appease her and keep her in my life to some degree.

She started seeing someone from her school about a month later. I was devastated. I hadn't healed or improved in the slightest, and she had already moved on. For the first time since the conversation started, it felt it was truly over. It felt that I had lost. I let things be and floated aimlessly through most days.

In October, she broke No Contact and asked if we could talk. My heart nearly leapt from my chest. This was the day I had spent months waiting, hoping, and praying for. Her admitting that she fucked up, begging for another chance. I know it's not healthy behavior, but I had envisioned it quite a few times. 

She first apologized for approaching me with it, but said she was desperate and that she needed support. She indicated her period was late, and that she had been feeling nauseous and lethargic for the better part of a week.

The whole fucking world might as well have came crashing down on me in that moment. 

She had been with this guy for a couple weeks, and they were *already* having sex? 

I was a mess of emotion--anger, sadness, jealousy, disgust, etc.--and I so desperately wanted to let it all boil over. But I didn't. I bottled it up and did my best to keep a clear head, walking her through the process of getting a pregnancy test as soon as possible. She admitted that the guy had more or less ghosted her and wasn't being much help. We talked semi-regularly up until the point she got the results from her test. Negative, thank God. After that, I wasn't of much use to her, so our conversations fizzled again, and we went No Contact once again.

Late November, her grandfather passed away. I broke No Contact to offer my condolences, and we talked a bit more like we used to.

She opened up to me about her relationship with the guy from her school, and I quickly realized just how toxic it was. It was in ever sense of the word a friends with benefits arrangement. They hardly went out in public together, let alone on dates. He never got her any gifts. Whenever they went over to each others dorm, it was for sex and sex alone. She admitted that she knew that and that she kept trying to see it as more than it was. She also stated she was having self-image and self-confidence issues and thought that was all she deserved.

Just like when she had ended things, I was equally caught of guard when she asked if I'd ever consider giving her another chance. I was conflicted. I couldn't deny that I still wanted her, and that I wanted a future with her. But I also recognized that over the course of the last few months, she had caused me so much pain, and single handedly put me in the darkest place I'd ever been. Ultimately, I agreed, and we started seeing each other again.

I wish I hadn't.

Fast forward to today, and we've been broken up for about a week--again. This time she indicated that it just didn't feel like it used to, and wants to take some time for herself. 

Totally fine. I would never expect her to stay in a relationship that she wasn't 100% happy with. I just wish she had come to that conclusion earlier.

I've tried to have a couple conversations about how we'd return each others belongings, but she's become more distant over the last few days. She's left my texts unanswered, and hidden her online status on social media. I decided I'm not going to go through that process again.

I still have her number, but I deleted all our texts and pictures. I un-added her on all social media to resist the temptation of checking her profiles.

It hurts, but I do think that I'm handling it better this time around compared to last year. I don't know what's to come, and I don't know if I'd ever give her another chance if it were to arise.

,BreakUps,"
I dated this guy who dealt with a lot of emotional baggage. I was there for him through thick and thin, but eventually it just brought my whole mood down. It felt great being a source of comfort but he eventually became way too dependent on me for his own happiness. I thought I loved him (and at some point, I probably did), but eventually, I found myself getting slightly annoyed over little things he did/said (he’s known to be complainer), not laughing at his corny jokes, and feeling indifferent when he said he loved me (which he always said very randomly and a bit too often where I felt it was awkward). I didn’t realize it originally but in retrospect, I was a bit standoffish towards the end of the relationship because I felt that my feelings for him were “different”, but didn’t have the words to explain it just yet. 

Throughout the relationship, we saw each other extremely often, which was fun at the beginning, but eventually felt like a chore because he would feel slighted if I decided I wanted to just chill and do my own thing alone, or if had already made plans with my own friends, who I already didn’t see often. As far as his own friends, he would go long periods of time without speaking to them or hanging out with them because he would rather give/get attention to/from me, but it was to the point where I would have to TELL him to actually interact with his own group of friends once in a while. Believe it or not, his own sister and aunt said he would lose me and his friends because of the way he acted.

The last bit of the relationship, my sex drive was pretty much non-existent for a month or two and I wasn’t even in the mood to make out with him. I even got annoyed with the way he HUGGED me. He would wrapp both arms over my shoulders and drag me down with his body weight and it constantly felt like I had to hold him up, which was exactly how it felt being in the relationship 40% of the time.

I wondered if our love languages were just different since he’s been way more affectionate and touchy, but in previous relationships I had expressed my love in the same way. I figured that the clinginess and the fact that he’s so insecure just made me extremely standoffish in those regards. 

Originally, I asked for a break to sort my feelings out. To clarify, when I said break, I meant no contact for a given time and no entertaining other people. I just needed ME time and to be honest, it had been the happiest I had been in a long time. I hung out with friends more often and took the time to have fun and do the activities I wanted to do (he was quite a homebody and I’m a bit more active/social). I think the time apart had been enough for me to realize that I didn’t see myself with him for the long run. I stayed longer than I should have because I wanted to spare his feelings since I knew how low he would feel.

,BreakUps,"Hello and welcome. I'm reporting here live from my first ever Reddit post. What brings me here today? Oh you knowww, the usual ""I'm (25F) in love with my forever person but we started dating when we were both pretty young and now he's feeling like he needs other dating/sexual experiences before he commits to something forever and on top of that he's a year younger than me and our life timelines can at times seem mismatched."" Yup, just another Thursday afternoon.  


In all seriousness, I've come to you all in a time of need and seeking advice. My boyfriend and I have been dating for 2 years and in that short amount of time, we've moved in together, met each others' families, dreamt up our future life together, and have had the most dreamy time together. A while ago though, he was upfront with me and told me that he was interested in sleeping with other women - not so much because he was looking for an open relationship, but because I was his first girlfriend and first genuinely good sexual experience. He said he had always imagined his 20s as a time to explore, date around, and really get to know others and himself in those experiences. And honestly, I get it. I've definitely had my fair share of dating and breakups. But as his girlfriend, it's pretty devastating to hear. It feels like I'm not enough for him, even though he reassures me that it has nothing to do with me.   


We've talked extensively about the matter and we both know one thing: we know we've got a good thing going and can still imagine spending our lives together. I think we both feel like we've found the one, although I think I feel it more at times because I have my other experiences to validate it against. I think at times he's scared and uncertain - how can he be certain when he's had no other experiences?   


Now, I know what the inner rom-com lover in you is saying: if he *really* loves you, then he wouldn't have to validate it with other experiences. And in an ideal world, sure I think that's true. But like I said earlier, I get it. I think in the tinder-bumble-you-can-have-everything-at-the-click-of-a-button world we're living in, it's almost silly to not want to go out and explore your options before fully committing.   


The problem is, as much as I can rationalize it, I'm still so deeply hurt by all of this. I'm also paralyzed by the fear of losing him. As of now, we've decided to ""take a break"" for two months this winter, while I'm with my parents. At the end of it, we're going to reconnect and decide whether we should stay together or break it off entirely. I am so, so, so worried. Like, I can't concentrate, eat properly, or pretend to be happy because I am terrified of the possibility of losing him.   


I know the general wisdom here is that we will get back together if it's meant to be. But what if I know it is and I don't want fate to decide that for us? What if he does find some other woman and falls in love with her? What if we just never get back together? I can't help but obsess over these thoughts and I feel like I've already spoken to him so much about it, and at this point, if I say anything more it just hurts the relationship.   


So what do I do? How do I navigate this time of uncertainty and still keep myself sane? How do I actually convince myself to not be jealous and to not think that ""this has anything to do with me""? Have any of you ever been through anything like this? Honestly, any wisdom here is much appreciated - I can't bear with this constant knot in my stomach any longer.",t2_2q5kn5pn,False,,0,False,"Taking a Break From ""the one"" (or at least who I think is ""the one"")",[],r/BreakUps,False,6,,0,,False,t3_iiahhm,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598661584.0,text,6,,,text,self.BreakUps,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello and welcome.

,BreakUps,"Sorry, this is my first time posting, and it’s very long. I don’t really know if this is the right place but I’m feeling impulsive

She broke up with me last year July while she was at a Summer Camp. She was a Senior and I had just graduated. We had lost so much of our summer to a one month trip that I had with my family so I wanted to reconnect with her because we felt so distant and I wasn’t used to it. She gave me about 30 minutes of her time each week. This was my first relationship so I didn’t know much, but this distance we had was killing me. We had barely talked for the last 1.5 months and I just wanted to feel like we still had each other. I had tried to keep things together during my trip but the time zone difference made you unable to communicate with me. I felt like we were breaking apart and I spent 2 days laying in bed doing nothing, just hurting over how neglected I had felt. I tried to understand that you were busy. I just couldn’t help that I had to initiate everything. I hated it. We had just fixed a rocky patch in our relationship and we were going to have our one year anniversary in 3 weeks but I broke. 

I messaged you and said I really needed to talk to you. I expressed how I felt, I broke down explaining how distant we felt. I’m and emotionally dependent person and I was only hurting myself by keeping it all in. I explained that I was missing you and asked if we could talk more. She left me. She said we ultimately wanted different things and she needed a break from emotions. I eventually came to understand that. 

What I didn’t understand is if you needed a break from emotions, why did you replace me. While we were dating she had told a guy at the camp “I would date you if I didn’t have a boyfriend”. She told me it was to make him feel better because he felt negative about his body and had opened up to her at a mental health event. I didn’t feel too hurt about this, even though she told me a month later. To me she was trying to cheer him up. What I was hurt about was that she ran to him when she was “taking a break from her emotions”. Granted she only kissed him, but it still hurt. She had told me this after a weeks of me trying to get back together with her and a couple days of us talking about it. I was shocked. We were talking in the parking lot but I couldn’t bare the thoughts. I ran into the school we were next to a and cried it all out. That was possibly the most hurt I had every felt but my naive mind didn’t want our efforts to “go to waste”. I knew it wasn’t cheating so I rationalized it.

We got together on the premise of being more casual in our relationship. But she clearly outlined her boundaries as things I didn’t want. When we were talking about getting together, she brought up the idea of being more casual and I was hesitant because I wanted some sexual intimacy between us and she assured me we could still be intimate. She also distanced herself from the guy and I appreciated the effort. But when we discussed boundaries she clearly outlined that we were not going to be intimate. I was confused as to why she would go back on this, but I accepted it hoping we could still move past this in the future. She continued listing her boundaries and I was fine with it besides the lack of intimacy. Then she said that she was putting a time limit on the relationship. 

She was applying for colleges and said that she was fine with being together in high school, but she wanted to break up once she left for college. I would still be in the same city because I was going to community college, but she was extremely smart and I knew she would be leaving eventually. I was heartbroken. How could someone put a time limit on love, I didn’t understand. As upset as I was I accepted her terms and we got back together. Needless to say I was a mess. I knew we had a year to be together, and knowing her personality she wasn’t going to change her mind so I stuck with it. I let her do this to me and I hate it, but it got worse.

College app season is stressful, I was there emotionally when she needed me and I did small things like surprise visit her with a coffee on the days she didn’t get much sleep. I thought I was doing my best to support her given the boundaries of a casual relationship. I just wanted to feel like I was being appreciated and my care was being reciprocated.

We went in study dates but it felt forced. We would chat in the car but you were always quick to ask if we could go. You went from initiating make out sessions to not even initiating small little pecks on the cheek. I came to you with my feelings and you occasionally spared an evening for us to have dinner together but it felt like I had to beg you to free up time. College apps are hard, I understood that, but they don’t take every single waking moment of your life. You told me second semester would be different, but what would be the point. Every time you said that it reminded me that our time was wasting away. We had a year left and you wanted me to just sit idly by for half of that time while you distanced yourself from me. It didn’t feel like a relationship.

Our last fight happened over homecoming. We had hung out/ had dates 2 times outside of studying. This was over a 2 month period, and during our study dates you studied so intently I was pretty much ignored, so I was hoping that I could spend time with you. I asked if you were going to homecoming and you said “probably not”. I proposed that if you didn’t go, we could hang out that night and just spend some time together. All I got was a “I can’t make any promises”. I was on the end of my rope. Tired of waiting, tired of giving in to her conditions. I wanted to be comfortable with us. 

Ultimately we broke up. That was last October. 2 weeks ago would’ve been our 2 year anniversary. I ended up accidentally drunk texting her and crying about her last week and I’m tired of it. I’m not very confident in my self anymore and I feel like I’m stuck. I keep looping back into the feeling of missing her. I have apologized to her for everything I have done during the relationship to try and bring me closure but I can’t move on. Last time we talked she said she was ultimately fine, and I don’t think she was lying. She’s fast to move on while I’m stuck with my emotions. It just feels like quicksand, slowly sinking and if I make any efforts to move on, I just sink faster.

Thank you for reading this if you guys got to the end. In the end I just want advice and am hoping that telling my story anonymously can also help. I can’t move on as much as I try and I just want some advice from a neutral perspective instead of going to my friends.

I don’t really know if this is the right place but I’m feeling impulsive&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She broke up with me last year July while she was at a Summer Camp. She was a Senior and I had just graduated. We had lost so much of our summer to a one month trip that I had with my family so I wanted to reconnect with her because we felt so distant and I wasn’t used to it. She gave me about 30 minutes of her time each week. This was my first relationship so I didn’t know much, but this distance we had was killing me. We had barely talked for the last 1.5 months and I just wanted to feel like we still had each other. I had tried to keep things together during my trip but the time zone difference made you unable to communicate with me. I felt like we were breaking apart and I spent 2 days laying in bed doing nothing, just hurting over how neglected I had felt. I tried to understand that you were busy. I just couldn’t help that I had to initiate everything. I hated it. We had just fixed a rocky patch in our relationship and we were going to have our one year anniversary in 3 weeks but I broke. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I messaged you and said I really needed to talk to you. I expressed how I felt, I broke down explaining how distant we felt. I’m and emotionally dependent person and I was only hurting myself by keeping it all in. I explained that I was missing you and asked if we could talk more. She left me. She said we ultimately wanted different things and she needed a break from emotions. I eventually came to understand that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I didn’t understand is if you needed a break from emotions, why did you replace me. While we were dating she had told a guy at the camp “I would date you if I didn’t have a boyfriend”. She told me it was to make him feel better because he felt negative about his body and had opened up to her at a mental health event. I didn’t feel too hurt about this, even though she told me a month later. To me she was trying to cheer him up. What I was hurt about was that she ran to him when she was “taking a break from her emotions”. Granted she only kissed him, but it still hurt. She had told me this after a weeks of me trying to get back together with her and a couple days of us talking about it. I was shocked.

,BreakUps,"I (22F) have known this guy (22M) since I was 15. We were close friends, we dated in high school, then we didn't talk for several years, and then we dated again for about a year in college, and that relationship started falling apart earlier this year. We essentially stopped talking to each other, there was no official break up. Throughout the relationship, I struggled to get him to understand that I needed some space and time to grow before anything else (we started talking again after I got out of a seriously traumatic 2 year relationship). It's not that I didn't want to date him, but that I wanted to make sure I was okay and could overcome my trauma first so that it would not carry over and end up hurting us down the line. He was caring, compassionate, sweet, and he helped me with a lot at that time in life. We had several fun adventures together as well. However, he tends to push my boundaries and it overwhelms me despite me telling him that I needed to take things slow/trying to set boundaries (he jumps from 1 to 100 pretty fast). Over time I felt progressively more invisible/blocked off. That's when things started to fade out.

It's been a couple of months since then and I still love him. And I know that he still has feelings for me as well. I've been able to think and go to therapy and work things out with my own self, but when I try to talk to him he kind of gets petty. I want to meet up with him and talk things out because I don't want him to think that I don't care about him and I want to set things straight. I'd like to start talking to him again, but I need him to understand that he has also hurt me with his actions and that these problems are not unsolvable. I'd also like to hear him out on his side of the story as well. I don't know how to suggest that we talk because the last time we texted each other he kept trying to make me jealous on purpose (it was so obvious and over the top take my word on this) about some girl he's talking to (not dating) pretty much right after we split. I know that he is hurt by what happened. It hurts me too. But he doesn't know that.

Although I'd like to solve our problems and get back together in the end because I know these issues are solvable and we make such a great team, it matters most to me that things are clear between us and he takes some accountability for his actions as I would like to my own. It would be great if we could talk and hang out again, but I also respect that he is ""talking"" to someone. I can sense that it is quite possibly a rebound, but were they to date I know that I would need to let nature run its course. It's just that when he comes out the other side of that I don't want him to not talk to me just because we never clarified our feelings and worked through our issues. I know I have to initiate things because he is hurt and I was the one who was more distant when things started to go to hell (the overwhelming situation led me to disassociate from my body/mind/life).

,BreakUps,"I surprised myself today.

For background, my ex dumped me 2 months ago after dating for 7 months because he felt that we were too different and he couldn't accept certain flaws in my personaility. I was definitely blindsided since he did not communicate these feelings to me before, and even though we didn't date that long, this is definitely the most difficult breakup I've dealt with by a long shot (like losing 15 lbs and crying for 2 weeks straight type of shit)

Today, I was cleaning out some files on my computer, and I found a 4 page letter that I wrote my ex 2 weeks after we broke up. So I made the obvious healthy choice and read it (lol). To summarize, this letter was basically me promising to change myself into everything he wanted, because if it made him happy then I would be happy. I was begging and pleading for him to love me again, to see that we were right for each other. I did send him the letter, but he wanted to remain broken up. 

Everything I wrote in that letter was what I thought to be true and genuine at the time. Reading the letter made me cry, not because it brought back the myriad or feelings I had at the time I wrote the letter, but because it makes me sad that I placed so much of my happiness on the success of that relationship, to the point where I was willing to sacrifice a lot of who I was to make someone else happy. I had so little self worth, that I was promising to change so much about myself to try to convince my ex to love me and want me the way I loved him. I just wanted to take the girl that wrote that letter, give her a big hug, and show her that things get so much better, and tell her she is worth so much more than someone who won't accept her for all of who she is, flaws and all. She deserves someone who will love her as much as she loves herself. 

Then I realized, I did tell that girl all those things eventually. Through therapy, self-care, lots of crying to friends/family, and borderline obsessive journaling, I have been grow into the person I am today, and I am in such a different place than I was when I wrote that letter. I still have a lot of work to do, but I am doing sooooo much better than the girl that wrote that letter. I still have my moments, but I was shocked to realize today how much I've healed and grown over the last couple of months, and I am truly proud of myself. 

For those of you still struggling, I promise you that you are going to look back at this time and be proud of the progress you've made. You'll get here too boo, I promise.

,BreakUps,"I just found out he slept with other girl today..

It hurts so much. Thinking about him being intimate with another girl in that way.. just makes me feel sick. 
At times I hate him for doing this to me. But other times I don't feel anything. Just a sense of numbness. A pain so great that I can barely register it. 
I've missed him so much these past couple of days that I was away. And today when I came back I find out that a week after I've left he decided to hook up with some girl he was speaking to. We were in such a good place, and now I can't even think about kissing him because all I think about is him kissing her and it makes me feel physically numb. What's even worst is that he didn't plan on telling me. He pretended that he missed me and I believed it, until I found out. 

I care about him so much. But I can't believe he disrespected me in this way and I don't understand what I did to deserve it.

&lt;p&gt;It hurts so much. Thinking about him being intimate with another girl in that way.. just makes me feel sick. 
At times I hate him for doing this to me. But other times I don&amp;#39;t feel anything. Just a sense of numbness. A pain so great that I can barely register it. 
I&amp;#39;ve missed him so much these past couple of days that I was away. And today when I came back I find out that a week after I&amp;#39;ve left he decided to hook up with some girl he was speaking to. We were in such a good place, and now I can&amp;#39;t even think about kissing him because all I think about is him kissing her and it makes me feel physically numb. What&amp;#39;s even worst is that he didn&amp;#39;t plan on telling me. He pretended that he missed me and I believed it, until I found out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I care about him so much. But I can&amp;#39;t believe he disrespected me in this way and I don&amp;#39;t understand what I did to deserve it. He was the first guy I&amp;#39;ve ever been intimate with and the only guy I will ever want to be intimate with, and it just hurts to know that he thought that what he did was okay.

,BreakUps,"I (29F) broke up with my first and only long-term partner ever about two months ago.  You can see my posts about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/attachment_theory/comments/hb5jj0/worried_ill_never_be_happy_with_another_person_da/) or [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/gx1k0x/i_28f_feel_closer_to_my_bf_27m_after_breaking_up/) (links are to my posts in Attachment Theory community and this community).  The details are honestly not super important for this particular post, because I think the feelings I'm having can result from many different situations, but tl;dr, I feel that the main things that caused me to break up with him were my anxiety disorder, his opposing anxieties, and a lack of being able to meet each other's needs past our separate anxieties.  (I always needed more space and freedom and he always needed me closer and more communication.)

I've gone in and out of intense feelings of not just missing him, but of SO MUCH guilt and regret that I couldn't fight through my anxieties. I do believe that breaking up was the right decision for who we each are as people right now, and nothing has changed since the break up that would imply that getting back together would be a good idea. In fact, I feel like I have genuine PTSD from the anxiety I experienced in the relationship.  We are trying to be friends but I never know how to communicate.  I'm overwhelmed with negative feelings about myself, and even though there were others factors, I can't stop thinking ""if only I could deal with my anxiety better, this wouldn't have happened."" I'm also really sad because even though this relationship put me through MULTIPLE spells of the worst anxiety of my LIFE, really what I would consider a breakdown (first round of it,before I got on antidepressants, I almost went to the hospital a couple times), in many ways I was the happiest I've ever been and he was really good for me. But bottom line is we couldn't support each other through my anxiety.   I also think we had different needs, although I'm in a phase of blaming myself almost entirely.

Now, I've been on antidepressants for a year with pretty good results and seeing a therapist for two years.  I've been doing everything you're supposed to do after a breakup: reaching out to friends and family (as much as possible during pandemic times), picked up new hobby, journaling, working out, talking to my therapist. I have come VERY far in all this time, but anxiety is a real bitch for me and it feels like a lifelong struggle. I don't think it's fair to expect myself to do any better than how I have been doing, but it doesn't feel like enough.  It doesn't ever feel like enough. I almost feel like I don't have  a good enough ""excuse"" to have caused us (my ex and I) all this continued pain.

,BreakUps,"My ex-girlfriend (20F) came a couple of months ago to my house to leave me (22M). I have a post about it. The thing is she called me and told me she wanted to talk and she admitted she acted thoughtlessly. I said I needed a time to think about it since I was really hurt because the person I loved the most did that to me. We eventually got back together but I made this clear: I had been doing all the emocional work and she destroyed what we had built together so I expected her to earn my trust back and work in this relationship. That happened in june.

Yesterday I went to talk to her because I didn't see that happening and she was very distant lately. I was used to have arguments in which I talked about what she makes and how I feel about it. I have no problem to admit I got really mad when I talked to her like that because I always had to be pulling out all the stops and manage to make her talk about her feelings. Usually, what happened was that I would say I'm mad about X and she would say ""Yeah, right? I'm mad about Y that you made 2 weeks ago"". We always ended up resolving nothing. Today I told her that. I also said I want to know what's she thinking and feeling and I want to help her grow intellectually (which was a problem for me because I felt like I contributed a lot in terms of music, cinema, literature, etc. but she didn't accept it and she would negate to grow and mature). I had made my mind to the idea that it would be like always and because of that I got her things I got in my house to be prepared for a break up.

What I wasn't prepared at all was the the things she said to me. She calmly exposed how she felt and told me a lot of stuff I had no clue and, if I had known, I would have acted quite differently. The thing is she ended up saying she's exhausted of everything and she has no energy to have another argument like that. I said that now I know how she feels and what are the problems we could work together to solve them. I tried to convince her this time would be different because I believed that from the heart. She ended up saying she needs some time. I respected that and I just gave her her things and said goodbye. I thought she needed some time and space but I saw her receptive and I felt we could at least try to solve our problems. I had hope.

Some hours later I wrote her a message and told her that we should talk before she moves because of college next month and make a decission, even if it was a goodbye. She answered very curtly that she had make a resolution and she wanted us to be apart, in very bad manners. I tried to make her feel respected and make her understand I didn't want to press her.

,BreakUps,"Hi all, I know this isn't really important but my anxiety is skyrocketing right now and I could really use some advice/encouragement.. I just noticed that my ex-boyfriend, with whom I've been together (and lived together) with for 2 years unfollowed me on Instagram.. We're 7 weeks into no contact. I had already unfollowed him a few weeks ago because I found myself constantly checking his profile and unfollowing him was the only way I could stop myself from doing this. I didn't even post that much since we went into no contact, I only posted one picture (of myself) a week ago, so it's not like I was spamming his feed or anything. 

Right now I just keep wondering why he unfollowed me. Did he unfollow me because I had unfollowed him? Did he unfollow me for the same reason I did, because he kept checking my profile? Or did he unfollow me because he's done with me and has moved on? We're still friends on Facebook, he hasn't blocked me on WhatsApp and he still follows my best friend's and sister's Instagram profiles, so I'm just really confused. I know we all aren't mindreaders and nobody will know the true reason, but I'd really appreciate it if anyone could provide some objective insight.

The no contact was mutually agreed upon as we both needed the time and space to work on ourselves, and he also told me that there's a big chance that he'll reach out to me. We have been through a lot together and agree that the bond between us is one of a kind and something we both value. Because of this, he told me he'd want to re-establish contact after some time and see if there would still be a romantic connection between us or if we could become friends (I already know that I don't want to be his friend though). Knowing this just confuses me even more and makes me wonder more why he unfollowed me. 

I was doing really well and the thoughts about him were affecting my emotions less and less, but seeing that he unfollowed me just really stings and has brought back the anxiety, so if anyone is willing to share their thoughts on this situation I'd really appreciate it.

I just noticed that my ex-boyfriend, with whom I&amp;#39;ve been together (and lived together) with for 2 years unfollowed me on Instagram.. We&amp;#39;re 7 weeks into no contact. I had already unfollowed him a few weeks ago because I found myself constantly checking his profile and unfollowing him was the only way I could stop myself from doing this. I didn&amp;#39;t even post that much since we went into no contact, I only posted one picture (of myself) a week ago, so it&amp;#39;s not like I was spamming his feed or anything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I just keep wondering why he unfollowed me. Did he unfollow me because I had unfollowed him? Did he unfollow me for the same reason I did, because he kept checking my profile? Or did he unfollow me because he&amp;#39;s done with me and has moved on? We&amp;#39;re still friends on Facebook, he hasn&amp;#39;t blocked me on WhatsApp and he still follows my best friend&amp;#39;s and sister&amp;#39;s Instagram profiles, so I&amp;#39;m just really confused.

The issue was, i casually mentioned i had a headache and he got annoyed, snapping at me and brushing off with his hand, saying, ""well just DON'T have a headache."" I tried to play it off as a joke, saying, ""wow thanks that worked,"" but i was actually hurt. Then he quietened and offered me something to drink. Then when i got home, i texted him hey i got home safe, he would usually reply, but he saw my text and ignored.

I thought maybe something was wrong so i brought it up a few days later, saying i felt disrespected, was he angry at me about something that day? He said he was just joking and being sarcastic and he wasn't angry. Said ""sorry if i intimidate you.""

I felt like that wasn't enough so i brought it up again a few days later. My mistake, maybe i should have let it go? But his reactions after were even worse than the first issue itself.

He said he didn't even know that something like that would bother me and he would probably do more things like that, he doesn't want to be with someone who is fragile with whom he can't talk how he likes. Now i'm not the type of person to take offense over nothing or not take a joke, but i don't think i was wrong to be upset about this incident?

He said again, ""You're soft. And i don't have the fucking luxury to provide comfort cause i don't care about comfort. If i have a problem i deal with it myself, and you should be grateful whatever help someone offers.""

I feel embarrassed now but i ended up desperately texting for weeks, trying to make him understand, he would just reply with more of the same, that i was soft, he wasn't going to apologise, i was being desperate, etc. Then he said, ""why should i respect you?

,BreakUps,"Hi guys,

I'm really wondering whethet my ex (m29) is confused or if he's keeping me warm?

He broke up 7 months ago. The months before I noticed that he became more and more depressed. He had an exhausting and horrible job, no friends and everything seemed to be going wrong for him. He kept pulling back, depressed, in something like an early midlife crisis.
He then broke up. Said he needef to get his life in order and be alone for that. He then said maybe he never loved me. It never felt like he didn't. We both moved out of our shared apartment. The last 2 days together, he was hysterically crying because of having today goodbye. We now live 6 hours apart from each other.

On one hand, he has driven 12 hours (forth and back) to see me twice in the last few months. He's still jealous (trying to hide it), suggested me finding a job near his city, talks about all thenplaces he wants to show me in his city, many compliments, checking out my area in case he lives there one day, staying in contact, tagging me in posts that remind me of him,keeps talking about past memories. What really confused me was one statement he made. He visited and we were joking/laughing about a situation in the past. He then accidently said ""I'll still tell the kids about that one day"". I've never known him to say stuff like that to manipulate. 

On the other hand he's on Tinder trying to find hookups, has an even worse job now thanks to Corona, sometimes doesn't message for 1-2 weeks, says breaking up was the right thing to do back in February and tried to sleep with me.

Is he keeping me warm or just generally not ready/confused

,BreakUps,"I’ve been with my partner for over a year now and I love and understand him so deeply and completely but our relationship has not been easy.

His mum hates me. She’s never met me, though. From what he’s told me the root causes of her dismissal of me as a viable partner are essentially racism and classisms (I’m mixed race and poor haha).

Apparently he’s been trying to bring her round to the idea of me for a long time but it ends up in arguments and tension no matter what he says. She emotionally blackmails him and says he will no longer be her son and she will cut him off from family and resources if he chooses me. This is the PG version of stuff I’m guessing as he said he doesn’t feel comfortable divulging most of what she says..

As you can imagine this has completely divided our relationship and we are pretty much on the rocks. He says he feels responsible for his aging mother who raised him all on her own, and as much as he loves me (he has started therapy to cope with the loss of our relationship and other things in his life, cried many times when he rarely shows emotion) he would rather condemn himself to a life of misery if it meant he wasn’t ‘betraying’ his mother and, in his words, abandoning her as he thinks he’s the only person she has. I’ve always been respectful of what he’s going through and never bad mouthed his mother. I suspect her reaction to me is fear-based (potentially ‘losing’ her son) and I have little power to interfere as this is between him and her. I have said as much to my partner, too.

I came here for some comments as this is so out of character for his otherwise individualistic, driven and problem solving nature.. Do we have any chance at recovering our relationship?

tldr: My partner loves me but his mother has threatened to essentially disown him if he continues being with me.

&lt;p&gt;His mum hates me. She’s never met me, though. From what he’s told me the root causes of her dismissal of me as a viable partner are essentially racism and classisms (I’m mixed race and poor haha).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently he’s been trying to bring her round to the idea of me for a long time but it ends up in arguments and tension no matter what he says.

,BreakUps,"Hello, I've been lurking this sub for a while (on an alt account as well) but I think I'm finally in a way better place and it's my time to go. There wasn't anything heinously bad about the split, but this one hurt so unbelievably much. There were a lot of unanswered questions and I was left with little closure. Her reluctance to communicate even before the split tore me up more than anything. She went NC before I had a chance to say what I wanted to which was one of the most painful experiences ever. I would always replay things in my mind and think of how I could've done things better. My self-esteem was at one of the lowest points in my life and my anxiety went through the roof. I was upset but I didn't feel okay blaming her because she was going through a lot of mental struggles and COVID certainly doesn't help. I was so lost. I didn't respond very well to how things played out and in the aftermath, I felt absolutely horrible about my response. I didn't berate her and it wasn't the ugliest thing, but still, I was a mess.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, at one of my lowest points, I signed up for therapy, and I'm so fortunate that I have access to this resource and that I paired up with a great therapist. I wish I had signed up for it sooner after the breakup; everything would have been so much better. It was such a game changer. If I did not have access to it, I would be nowhere near recovery and would probably be lying in bed for most of the day. Having someone to talk to and give me a different perspective helped so much (I don't talk about my relationship issues much with family and friends). Reflecting on what happened in a healthier way has been so helpful. I'm working on what I feel are negative behavior patterns and my therapist is training me on other things as well. I'm not sure what it was but one day after therapy, I just felt that dark cloud over me lift. I'm not 100% and deep down, I think I'll always feel some pain about what happened, but I think the hardest part is through. I still struggle, am reluctant to look at old photos, and stay clear from certain songs or shows. However, I finally feel like ""myself"" in some ways again and I'm not a mess 95% of the day. I'm able to cast aside many of my irrational resentment when it creeps up for whatever reason and I'm able to forgive me her for anything else. I still think she is a wonderful person and I'm able to recognize that, for the most part, the universe was just horrible to us and things didn't pan out, and it's hard to fault anyone.

,BreakUps,"My ex-girlfriend (48f) of 3.5 years and I went on a road trip for 4th of July. The week after that was great. She then began getting irritable (over tiny things) and started fighting. She wanted to break up (we have broken up several times and got back together).

She began bringing up past arguments as a reason for why we can’t be together. 1 month ago on July 24th, we broke up over the phone (calmly) at around 5pm. I accepted it. At around 10pm, I went to a nearby park to walk. She then called me and asked what I was doing to which I answered “I’m walking”. She shows up. 

I’m by myself and she sees that. She asks to see my phone and in my confusion as to why she was aggressive, I gave her my phone but she did not find anything suspicious (we’re broken up anyway). She “leaves” bothered and I keep walking. I see an acquaintance (50’s man) at the park. I walk towards him and start talking to him. She pulls up to the parking lot again. Since I know that she’s suspicious (she has always accused me of talking to other girls, checking out other girls, etc), I decided to tell this man to follow me to meet her so that she could see I’m NOT with a girl. 

I introduce her as my girlfriend and him as my friend. He then starts saying how him and I have been running into each other at the park and how we sometimes walk together and try to do push-ups etc. She was already upset from a few minutes prior. She then says she has to leave but before she does, she tells me “dude, you’re fucking gay” and I laughed it off and walked away. 

A few days later on August 4th, I went to talk to her. Long story short, she was not angry anymore but said that she couldn’t be with me. She said she loves me, would have liked to be with me, but can’t anymore. She says to leave it up to God and I leave her house. We hug and kiss. THEN 2 WEEKS NO CONTACT. 

After the 2 weeks no contact, I go see her and she does not seem excited to see me. We talked for about 30 minutes. She seemed conflicted with her decision to stay broken up. I try talking to her the next day but it was the same. 

The following day (August 20th), I send her a message saying I will respect her space. She responds saying that she must do this but is also hurting. I was already near her house so I knock on her door. She opens and let’s me in. She’s crying (I’m shocked). She admitted to crying when alone but not in front of me. We talk for a couple of hours and watch TV while sitting on the floor. It’s nighttime so she leans on the couch to close her eyes and I hug her and have her head on my chest. She stays resting. She says she will walk me out but before she does, I try to hug her again and she told me not to because “it brings her back to the night she saw me with the guy at the park”. We argue because I feel disrespected and then I leave. She says I’m gay and talks a lot of shit. I leave. 

The next couple of days, I tried talking to her but she seems angry from our argument on August 20th and she brings up all the arguments since 2017 as to why I haven’t been good to her and then adds that I “left her for a man” that night at the park. We message each other the next day and she simply says that we will not be together again (she has said this before during other breakups). I didn’t respond and we haven’t talked or seen each other since. This was 4 days ago.

,BreakUps,"So here's my story. Met this wonderful woman 6 years ago. We fell in love and all the usual things. However, we were both adults still living with our parents. I have always had a hard time keeping a job long term, and she actually had a college degree from a big uni in Florida, but she was very complacent working at the same rinky dink job for the last 4 years, making a poverty line salary. However, I never judged her for this. I still loved her and didn't think much of it, because in my mind, I believe that if we were all to wake up tomorrow and the value of the dollar dropped to zero, all you would have at that point is love and companionship.

However. The same rules didn't apply to me. For years, she would tell me to find a steady job and hold on to it so we can move out and grow as a couple. My problem is I can never find happiness or fulfilment in anything I do, so my usual routine was to find a well paying job, save up money to last me until I inevitably get fired or quit, find a new job, repeat. Despite my problem keeping a job, I still was able to take her out of town occasionally and pay all our bills on time. I never leeched off of her. But again, I was complacent and ignoring the bigger picture; she was throwing hints that if I didn't get my shit together and get us into our own place then she was going to leave me. 

The mistake I made was calling her bluff every time she would follow through on it. For the last couple years, she would break up with me, I'd profusely apologize and swear I'd change, but once I got her back I would go right back to being lazy and doing the bare minimum. I figured she wouldn't be able to just let all these years of being together go down the drain and she was just frustrated. 

Well, people, a few days ago she reached her breaking point and called things off. The text went like this: ""The truth is. I love you but I've have fallen out of love with you. I see no future. I see no hope. I have been lying to myself. Praying for some miracle but.. why delay the envitable. I resent you for not keeping a job. I no longer see you as viable partner.😭  I feel like you could be the one if you had a steady job but...""

I was devastated. When I called her up that night, I immediately knew something was different this time. There was an edge to her tone. She was speaking with a different kind of conviction. I'm not a rookie; I've heard this tone before and I knew what was happening. She was leaving me and she was not going to change her mind. I begged, I pleaded, but I could tell her mind was made up. She told me she couldn't wait around any longer, that she hopes by leaving me it will motivate me to do something with my life and if I wanted a future with her then I need to find steady employment. 

Needless to say, I'm devastated. I love this woman with all my heart. It's one thing for a woman to leave you, it's another for her to leave you because she essentially thinks you're not a real man. And they worst part is, we talked last night (likely the last time we will ever speak again for a long time.... possibly ever) and she told me there's always hope we can get together again. She wants to lose weight and work on becoming the woman I first met, and she wants me to become the man she first met, except this time with steady income and a place of his own. But fucks sake, that could be 6 months, a year, God knows how long. By then, will she even care about me anymore? Will I even care? Will she have found someone new? She may discover that life without me is beautiful and she won't even remember the conversation we last had. 

So here I am. 6 years later, heartbroken. Because it's my fault. If I hadn't been so lazy and buckled down, we would still be together and likely married. Instead, she's gone and there's a very real possibility I'll never see or hear from her again, and even if I do, there won't be any love there. It'll just be.....a conversation with someone I used to know. So take it from me, guys and girls.

&lt;p&gt;However. The same rules didn&amp;#39;t apply to me. For years, she would tell me to find a steady job and hold on to it so we can move out and grow as a couple. My problem is I can never find happiness or fulfilment in anything I do, so my usual routine was to find a well paying job, save up money to last me until I inevitably get fired or quit, find a new job, repeat. Despite my problem keeping a job, I still was able to take her out of town occasionally and pay all our bills on time. I never leeched off of her. But again, I was complacent and ignoring the bigger picture; she was throwing hints that if I didn&amp;#39;t get my shit together and get us into our own place then she was going to leave me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mistake I made was calling her bluff every time she would follow through on it. For the last couple years, she would break up with me, I&amp;#39;d profusely apologize and swear I&amp;#39;d change, but once I got her back I would go right back to being lazy and doing the bare minimum. I figured she wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to just let all these years of being together go down the drain and she was just frustrated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, people, a few days ago she reached her breaking point and called things off. The text went like this: &amp;quot;The truth is. I love you but I&amp;#39;ve have fallen out of love with you. I see no future. I see no hope. I have been lying to myself. Praying for some miracle but.. why delay the envitable. I resent you for not keeping a job. I no longer see you as viable partner.😭  I feel like you could be the one if you had a steady job but...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was devastated. When I called her up that night, I immediately knew something was different this time. There was an edge to her tone. She was speaking with a different kind of conviction. I&amp;#39;m not a rookie; I&amp;#39;ve heard this tone before and I knew what was happening. She was leaving me and she was not going to change her mind. I begged, I pleaded, but I could tell her mind was made up. She told me she couldn&amp;#39;t wait around any longer, that she hopes by leaving me it will motivate me to do something with my life and if I wanted a future with her then I need to find steady employment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, I&amp;#39;m devastated. I love this woman with all my heart. It&amp;#39;s one thing for a woman to leave you, it&amp;#39;s another for her to leave you because she essentially thinks you&amp;#39;re not a real man. And they worst part is, we talked last night (likely the last time we will ever speak again for a long time.... possibly ever) and she told me there&amp;#39;s always hope we can get together again. She wants to lose weight and work on becoming the woman I first met, and she wants me to become the man she first met, except this time with steady income and a place of his own. But fucks sake, that could be 6 months, a year, God knows how long. By then, will she even care about me anymore? Will I even care? Will she have found someone new? She may discover that life without me is beautiful and she won&amp;#39;t even remember the conversation we last had. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here I am. 6 years later, heartbroken. Because it&amp;#39;s my fault. If I hadn&amp;#39;t been so lazy and buckled down, we would still be together and likely married. Instead, she&amp;#39;s gone and there&amp;#39;s a very real possibility I&amp;#39;ll never see or hear from her again, and even if I do, there won&amp;#39;t be any love there. It&amp;#39;ll just be.....a conversation with someone I used to know. So take it from me, guys and girls. If you want to keep your SO, make sure you&amp;#39;re holding up your end of the deal financially.&lt;/p&gt;

I told him that despite how many times I tried to leave I stayed because I love him (we were long distance). I told him I was angry. He told me he broke down because of what I said.

,BreakUps,"**This is my first weekend after breaking up. I am living in Saigon, Vietnam. The rainy season in Saigon now makes me feel more lonely.**

*(I am sorry if my English is not good)*

I believe that I and him did make the world a better place together. We served homeless people together, traveled together, laughed together, cried together, got lost together, got rained together, cooked together.  We would have gone out last Thursday, this Sunday, and more. He promised that he would not leave me. He promised we would get married and build a family together. I really believed in him.

And it all ends with a message. It's the truth! He broke up with me over a text when his house is just 10 minutes riding from my place.

Before breaking up, he had always tried to take revenge on me in everything. I forgot to do for him one thing, he also had to find a similar thing to treat me the same. I said a sentence to him, he had to find a similar sentence to tell me. He was tit for tat.

I was confused and tried to find the answer, but all I said just pissed him off. And then, he suddenly broke up with me. In that moment, I briefly thought about death. But I know I never will.

I texted his mother for announcing the breakup because I always respect her. For my mother, he doesn't care, even though she has always been nice and cares for him. Now I have to let her know by myself. How sad my mother will be because she has the 100% character of a Vietnamese traditional woman. To think about it hurts me a lot.

Now is 8 pm on Friday, I eat some junk food, watch a movie and surf Reddit, without him. Maybe I'll go out with friends tomorrow. I still have a normal life, but deep down inside, there are invisible spaces because of his leaving.

He emailed me after I have blocked him on social media to say he still loves me and breaking up is better for me. My heart hurts because I know he is lying just for having my attention back.

By logical thinking, I know I will pass over it. But the first weekend after breaking up is so sad for me. I have many memories and need time to get over all of them.

1 month of NC. 

It's been hell...especially seeing you in that bar with another man's tongue down your throat 3 weeks after we broke up. 

But today it seems I finally got a job in my new field. Something I was insanely anxious about...seeing as I was an unemployed student at 30 years old studying again.

In fact, it was the reason you broke up with me the 3rd time...because I wasn't ""stable"". 

I didn't have a job...and you had a kid and wanted a ""provider"" I guess. You wanted financial security after the mess your ex left you in. 

The question I asked you then still haunts me: 

*""When I get a job and deal with my anxiety...do you want me to come find you?""*

And your reply: 

*""...Yes.""*

Then you came back a week later - telling me that ""love was more important"" - that it wasn't my anxiety  - it was yours...that money didn't matter...but clearly in the end it did. 

I want to tell you so badly...you're about to go study for another 4 years at 29 years old...I want to help you. But after what you've done, how you've treated me, how easily you threw me aside and moved on...I know I shouldn't.

,BreakUps,"I know that you still love them so much. You can’t imagine how you can live without them in the future. You think it’s impossible to move on and love again. But trust me, this is just a part of your grieving process. Your brain is playing tricks on you. 

Allow yourself to feel whatever you’re feeling right now. It’s okay if you still want them back so desperately, but **please don’t contact them**. Even if you want them back, contacting them will just ruin your chance to get them back. Your ex is aware about how you’re feeling.

Trust me, I’ve been there. My ex was my favorite person. I felt like I put everyone and everything else in the back burner while I was in a relationship with him. I was so attached to him. When he broke up with me, I was so devastated. I was in denial, couldn’t believe that it happened, begged for a second chance, couldn’t eat properly for weeks, watched every video and article about how to get your ex back, had nightmares, and I couldn’t focus on anything as I was constantly thinking about him.

But let me tell you this, the pain does fade. I know you’ve heard this many times, but time does heal. I wish I knew this was possible. I thought I wouldn’t make it out of the pain, but I did. Today I looked at our pictures, and I just smiled, thankful that we made many good memories. I miss the feelings and the memories, but I don’t miss the person I was looking anymore. I don’t miss “us” anymore. But I don’t hate him because I realize he made the right decision.

Now I can’t imagine if he did reach out to me before I reached this stage. I would desperately run back to him. If that happened, I’m sure I wouldn’t be the person that I am now.

I’ve made many changes since my breakup happened. I started fixing my sleep schedule. I started doing yoga regularly. I started painting and reading books again. I reconnected with a few old friends. I spend more time with my family more often. I fall in love with my solitude. I’ve learned and done many things that I don’t think I would do if I was still with him. But the progress wasn't linear. There were times when I felt like I was back at square one. Some days I would feel like I already moved on and the next day I would find myself crying in the bathroom again. I would beat myself up for not making progress. Looking back, I realize that through the ups and downs, *I was making progress* without even realizing it. So if you're feeling like I did, please remind yourself that it's totally normal to feel that way. 

This subreddit helped me a lot in getting to this stage, so I would like to thank all of you from the bottom of my heart.

Embrace your pain, face your emotions, and one day when you’re finally over the breakup you’ll realize that it happened for a reason. In the meantime, please take care of yourself. We’re all in this together. You’re all wonderful people. Keep healing &lt;3

,BreakUps,"Hello to all
This is the first time I post something and it's very unnerving and undeniably liberating as well! 

It has been five days since I spoke with my boyfriend and it all started with him announcing to me about his fantasies and dreams about his female coworkers.

Some may think it's pretty of me to forfeit trust and not see him; little do you know that in the past, he has always taunted me with comments about the opposite sex. 

We were on and off due to our distance which is Washington State to Oregon. To some, it isn't all that far but to him, it's a hassle to see me, I suppose. This did put a strain in my faith and trust in him.

As far as I can remember, I always went to see him since he claims that he is more comfortable at his own place and he works from home as well. Fair enough, I thought. 

As time went on, he'd get very graphic with how he'd look at other women and that he has urges to talk to them or day dreams about the ""hot ones"". If you were me? Would you be upset or jealous or full blown scream sessions at him? 

I did all THREE

All is tolerable until I found out that he even had an online dating profile and went on two coffee dates when we were arguing and of course, I wasn't with him 24/7 not was I even in Oregon! 

To make it short, I eventually told him I can do this anymore and my heart is shattered. 

Did I made a mistake? 
Does he deserved another chance?

A month in, I still felt awful. But I felt like he will come back and reach out to me again, just like the other times. I had some hope, although I wasn’t sure if it will happen. I would dream about him every night. 

A month and a half in, I would feel the same but have days where I wouldn’t care at all and felt like there may be better guys out there for me. 

Two months in, I feel bad one day and then can’t careless the next. But one thing that changed drastically is, I cannot stand guys. I’m still on the dating apps, but they all just disgust me (as harsh as it sounds). I know I should get off of them, but they do help me in a way! I make it clear I’m just looking for people to talk to, that way I don’t lead anyone on.  

I miss the cuddles and just having someone there. But I cannot picture doing that with anyone... but him. I know, it’s still early after the breakup, but I am trying to understand my feelings. 

I want him back... but I can’t take him back. He left me 3 times... although the reason for it comes from both ends. I feel bad about not having him here, but at the same I want him.

,BreakUps,"
Hello all! In need of some advice or emotional support if you will. So, to give some perspective...I (22m) have been out of my 2yr relationship with my ex (22f) for about 8 months now and have grown my fair share personally since then. But this has been a roller coaster an amount of time to say the least. 

Our breakup could have been described as natural being that she simply fell out of love with me, but being the dumpee it hurt like hell. For me it had come out of left field while I thought it was a relationship that was going well. I left her house that day still not knowing 100% what went wrong because I had given my all to her. Now I was aware of some imperfections to our relationship so I could figure a few things to be the reason but couldn’t put a finger on it. But one thing she told me was that she simply didn’t want a relationship at this time as well as the typical “it’s not you it’s me” and “let’s take some time to grow separately” sort of reasoning. I knew at the time the she had made her mind up and no longer wanted to be with me and I could understand and respect that. The last thing I would want to do is keep a loved one in a stale or emotionally uncomfortable state and would prefer to let them grow without me in question. So we mutually ended things though I hadn’t gained much closure and due to my stubborn independence and situation, I would keep all of my emotions to myself unfortunately. 

So fast forward since January and as I stated I’ve done a hell of a lot of growing and I’m proud of myself for it. I got an internship, practiced some self care doing the things I love, and will soon be moving out to Colorado with my closest friends who I’ve missed dearly. I’ve seen my ex twice since we ended things and haven’t spoken to her since April, which sucks because I truly lost my closest friend but I’ve wanted nothing but the best for her. I unfollowed/muted her on multiple platforms for my own piece of mind and it’s been this way for months. However just this week I happened to see her post photos of a new relationship with a previous friend. Now I completely comprehend that eight months is an absolute unit of time for some and believe that she is free to do whatever she pleases, without me in question. But I can’t help but remember the words she spoke and filled my head with about not wanting a relationship and left me believing that she still cared to mend what we had eventually. I suppose this all stings a bit more because of the friendship that we had and how much we had grown together. I personally made it a goal to communicate emotionally to each other in our relationship because that’s what you do. But as time goes on it seems she was one foot in more time than I knew and it left me heartbroken. 

I can tell at this time that I was more emotionally mature and the primary communicator but that doesn’t mean I can’t feel some shit you know? We all wish to believe our SO was “the one” or that our relationship was more than something that could be brushed off and forgotten so easily, I sure have wanted to. But as I type this it’s currently sad boy hours and I suppose what I’m in search of is some advice/support moving forward or anyone who has similar experiences. How do the empathic folks like myself cope? Am I just holding on to all that’s dead and gone? (I’m listening to beach house currently) Or did she just say those things to get over me and move on quickly? I certainly appreciate anyone who has read this all because I don’t typically share this with anyone in my life but I had to get it out to someone somehow.

,BreakUps,"I (27F) was with my ex (26M) for two years. We met and hit it off immediately and in my culture you get married quickly. So we started to plan it all but his mum suddenly decided I wasn’t right for her son so she called it all off about six months in when we had set dates and all was in place.

Then started the drama of the last year - he leaves and blocks me and then comes back soon afterwards. More than once he’s come and said let’s make this work but he won’t talk to his mum. He ghosts a lot too. When he goes awol or ghosts or blocks me I don’t even message him, he always contacts me.  

Anyway, last time we spoke at the beginning of July, he said he misses me but can’t see us progressing (it’s always his mum who’s the issue, i don’t really understand it). So I did NC for a month to get over him finally, during which time he messaged me every few days random things. One message wasn’t even nice but I think he was trying to get a reply. 

But then 3 weeks ago he messaged me to say his mum mentioned me in conversation and he wants to meet when he’s back in the city. 

I don’t really understand because even now he isn’t in contact with me. I worry when he’s back he won’t even meet me and he’ll ghost then too.

,BreakUps,"So I was in a relationship for 3.5 years. It was my only serious relationship and the only person I ever really loved. We were in a long-distance relationship and there were some other minor problems which I now think could easily have been fixed but at the time were bothering me. Mostly I felt that the magic that was once there was starting to fade.

I then went on a semester abroad making the distance even longer. At the start of this semester we get into a fight and I just feel like I don't want to deal with this now. I tell her some things I regret and say we should probably break up. She starts begging me not to break up with her and keeps calling me and cries the whole time. At this point I really just want some quiet and get settled in my new place, so I hang up on her while she is crying. That makes her so desperate that she jumps off a bridge to kill herself the same night. Luckily she survives with just minor injuries. At this point of course I feel terrible, but I'm also glad she survived and I still think it was probably right to break up.

Maybe one week goes by and I start missing her. I remember all of our good memories and start to realize that I didn't appreciate enough what I had with her. Normally I would ask her to forgive me and forget what I said, but I feel like I can't hurt her to the point where she tries to kill herself and then just be like ""Oh nevermind, let's get back together."" The rest of the semester I don't feel good, but I manage pretty well not to think about it too much, because I have plenty of other stuff to do and being in this new environment everything doesn't quiet feel like real life.

Four months later the semester ends and I am back home. Pretty quickly I meet this girl who seems really nice. We start getting closer and now everything really starts to hit me. Everything we do reminds me of my ex and I start feeling terrible. I regret hurting her so much and I can't forgive myself. I try to suppress my feelings and keep dating this new girl for two months, because I really do feel a connection to her and I think I could fall in love with her if I wasn't in this situation. But I keep feeling worse and worse, so I tell her that I am not over my ex and that I can't do this anymore. She is hurt of course but she says she understands me.

I start texting my ex a lot and beg her to give me another chance, but of course I am way too late. I now basically feel terrible everyday and just try to think of ways to get her back. I send her love letters, I send her flowers, I do whatever I can, but she doesn't love me anymore.

Now the break up was pretty much exactly one year ago. Maybe one month ago I start feeling a little bit better. I start thinking maybe I am ready to let her go. I also start thinking about the other girl and how I could probably have a good time with her now. I start using Tinder, not even really actively looking for a relationship, but also just to maybe have some people to talk to, since I didn't have too much social interaction since the pandemic started. 

Two weeks ago I meet this girl on Tinder and it seems we really click. We text all night. The next morning I wake up and I feel really happy. I realize this is the first time I wake up happy since my break up and how I forgot what it feels like to be happy.

We met up twice now and both dates went good, but after the second date I started to feel depressed again. I keep thinking about how I could be completely myself when I was with my ex and how free I felt, but of course it is not fair to compare a relationship of 3.5 years with the feeling after the second date. I just don't know how to feel now. I already feel bad because it didn't work out with the previous girl, because of the state I was in. I am scared to throw away another opportunity to find love. It is my first time going through this so I just don't know if the thoughts about my first girlfriend will ever go away if I don't try to give another girl a chance and some more time. So should I keep meeting her or stop before I will just hurt her even more?  


  
I don't know if anyone will even read this, but it felt good to write it down to sort my thoughts. I realize I may sound like an idiot and I know I was.

I start using Tinder, not even really actively looking for a relationship, but also just to maybe have some people to talk to, since I didn&amp;#39;t have too much social interaction since the pandemic started. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago I meet this girl on Tinder and it seems we really click. We text all night. The next morning I wake up and I feel really happy. I realize this is the first time I wake up happy since my break up and how I forgot what it feels like to be happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We met up twice now and both dates went good, but after the second date I started to feel depressed again. I keep thinking about how I could be completely myself when I was with my ex and how free I felt, but of course it is not fair to compare a relationship of 3.5 years with the feeling after the second date. I just don&amp;#39;t know how to feel now. I already feel bad because it didn&amp;#39;t work out with the previous girl, because of the state I was in. I am scared to throw away another opportunity to find love. It is my first time going through this so I just don&amp;#39;t know if the thoughts about my first girlfriend will ever go away if I don&amp;#39;t try to give another girl a chance and some more time. So should I keep meeting her or stop before I will just hurt her even more?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if anyone will even read this, but it felt good to write it down to sort my thoughts. I realize I may sound like an idiot and I know I was. I also realize you always want what you can&amp;#39;t have, but I just really believe that everything could have been perfect with my ex if only I had put in more effort.&lt;/p&gt;

,BreakUps,"I want to start this post off by saying it might not apply to everyone, but ive been thinking alot about my breakup and all the others ive read on this sub. I think my message is one everyone can benefit from reading. (Its a long read so be prepared!)

Every breakup is unique. All of us are here fir a different reason. Theres no one event that leads to the end of every relationship. It may have been your ex cheating on you. It may have bee due to covid. It may have been due to something you did. It might have been a “falling out of love” scenario. It may have been due to family issues. It may have been due to mental health issues. We may be the dumper. We may be the dumpee.

However we all do have a few things in common. All of us here are in pain. All of us here are experiencing heartbreak and we dont know how to handle it. Thats why we’re on this sub. We’re looking for support from strangers on reddit. Some people may think its a sign of weakness. Ive been told countless times to “move on” or “forget them” by my friends and family. However they dont necessarily know the pain we’re in. I think its amazing that we can be here to support eachother. Ive had countless people reach out and talk to me about my breakup- giving me kind words and advice about my situation. 

There is nothing wrong with being sad at the end of a relationship. As the cliche goes, it just takes time. Allow yourself to feel the emotions youre going through. Dont try and bottle them up. In order to heal you have to ventilate your pain. You cant push it down and burry it under distractions or rebounds. 

In the end though we all need to realize a few things. The fact that we’re here means that we TRULY loved someone- we may not have been perfect, but noone is. True love is so rare in today’s society and it means alot that we all loved someone despite their flaws. We should never feel stupid for placing our trust in someone that clearly did not (whatever the circumstances may be) reciprocate that trust and love. After all when you fall in love with someone thats the most vulnerable you can be in life- youre giving them the power to break your heart. Thats something we should be proud of, not ashamed of. 

Dont let this heartbreak turn you callous. Dont allow it to change the loving person you once were. Instead, allow it to fuel you into being even better. Start working out, running, doing any physical activity to make you healthy. Work on your mental health- in whatever way you can. Maybe start reading books to make yourself smarter. Build stronger relationships with your friends and family. Dont turn to drugs or alcohol to cope. Dont turn to a rebound either. Rebounds may help you distract yourself but in the long run they usually hurt you even more. 

As all of you are, i am still in pain. Its only been a month and a half so its still fresh for me. Ive seen people on this sub move on after a week or two, and ive seen others on here years after the break. Dont push yourself to move on faster. Its a natural process that cant be rushed. And thats okay. 

If anyone reads this and needs advice about their situation, or theyre hurting and want to share their story with someone. Please feel free to message me or comment. I love listening to people and trying to help them. Its my passion in life, so feel free to talk to me with no judgement.

It’s a fucking pain but I still somehow know in the back of my mind that it’s gonna go away at some point, which kinda makes it more bearable.

We’ve met in January 2019 when she was going through a very sad period of her life. The first 6 months were very intense. We both felt like we were the perfect match. The first 4 months we’ve been in a long distance relationship and then we moved together as she got a job in the same city I was living. Things were amazing.

However, she didn’t quite enjoy that city and her problems started to reapper slowly. Being paranoid for no apparent reason, thinking I was cheating on her, reading about all sorts of diseases on the Internet that she thought she might have. Her mind was playing her. It went on like this for months. Things were getting worse and worse but I was trying to do my best to be next to her and help her get through this.

She had moments when she was screaming at me for literally no reason or asking me to block ex girlfriends on instagram. But I tried to empathize with her and understand her trust issues who were built on shitty past experiences. I wanted to prove that I really loved her for who she was and I’d never betray here.

We decided to move to another city. Before that, I went a month back to my family and she went to hers. On the day of my flight back to her, that country imposed a travel ban due to Covid so we had to stay 4 months separated. 4 months where she only stayed with her parents and things got worse and worse for us.

There were so many moments I though about breaking up with her but I never did because I knew what I saw in her and put everything on the fact that we weren’t living in the right place or because the Covid restrictions and the fact we had to be apart for months.

Then we finally met at her parents house where we had literally no privacy. They’re nice people but they live in a small place. Things weren’t getting any better because of so many accumulated frustrations. Startinf from the lack of proper communication, to the lack of sex and her beinf on her phone google diseases.

Then boom. We went for a holiday and we were supposed to get a place somewhere after two weeks, as we both work remote. She said that she wants to focus on herself and that some things really left a scar on her and she’s not able to do this right now. I can totally understand what she feels and can respect that. The fact she dumped me out of the blue is just very frustating. Right before we would’ve been able to get our own nice place in a city we both lovee

My english is not the best and I hope I made sense above. It’s just that I’m so sad and dissapointed because of how easily she got rid of me when I could’ve done the same to her however I preffered being there for her. It’s just that I never expected that from her and it just happened. My expectstions were so high and the impact was and still is very devastating.

,BreakUps,"This is a long story because what happened is very complicated.

We met right before COVID started. Thanks to this pandemic, we were the quarantine babies to each other. Both of our families are far away and we had to stay because of the work. We were like a family for three months. It was a great time together and we felt like we clicked perfectly. We enjoyed each other’s company. I have been traumatized before this relationship. This pandemic brought me really close to this person and gave me hope that I can finally trust and love again.

Well, if it is a happy story, I wouldn’t be writing right here now. The first time we fought is because staying home for too long and got tired of the miscellaneous house works, but soon I found out that’s not the only reason. He was unhappy sometimes and he didn’t know how to tell me he was not happy about something. Those frustration just accumulated and exploded. He became crazy, and then he threw me out of his place. I was super desperate and heartbroken. Luckily, I got a friend who can help to shelter me from being homeless. 

I thought that was the end of the story, but not really. He called three days after. He started to apologize and told me how he really feel. He wanted to get back together. I still loved him, so I said yes if he promises he will never act crazy again. We talked things through and spent some happy and exciting time again. 

Not long after, he broke up with me. He told me the reason is that I complained too much, but from my point of view is that he wants me to follow his mood. His mood is like a cycle. A week of being a gentleman and sweet, and another week being intense and drove me crazy with the pressure. When he is upset, the whole world should tolerate his rude behaviors. 

I couldn’t leave him. It was too shocking for me that he wants to break up again. Cause I was already improving the thing we fought about the first time. Then, there’s another thing that is my fault? I started question myself. 

Worst is yet to come. He wants to stay friends. Not just a friend, but a special friend who can have sex with. I just couldn’t refuse and we kept that for several weeks until one day when he told me he went out with a girl, I finally couldn’t take it anymore. I couldn’t constrain myself from valuing him as my boyfriend. I would want to share my thoughts and life with him, but he did not want to. I told him I would never ever want to see him or talk to him again. 

Again, I thought this is the end. He called again that night. I didn’t pick up instantly. He called 10 times and I thought it was something life threatening serious, but it turnt out that he was only going to tell me he was very upset and crying about how empty he felt. Foolish me, I went over to his place to comforted him. Then he asked for sex. I didn’t wanna fall into another unhealthy cycle, so I left. 

I thought I made up my mind and I am already strong that for the first time, I tell him no, even though I still have love to him. I overrated myself. The emotions and thoughts of wanting him back kicked in when it was the time we always hang out together. I called him. He came and while we were talking, he told me that he slept with someone else. Then he started talking about how people nowadays don’t consider COVID that serious anymore and want to have several sexual partners to be happy. I was so disappointed and cried like the world ended the next day after sobering up. 

A week later, today, I am still crying every night and feel extreme anxious. I was so desperately looking for closure and reasons not to love him each time. He just crushed my defense with one single call. Somewhere in my mind, he is still that sweet boy who knows how to make me happy. Then the next minute, he becomes something else. I don’t know where to look for my closure anymore. I don’t wanna talk to him anymore but I cannot help myself from missing him. I feel I cannot trust anyone anymore.

,BreakUps,"So my boyfriend of 10 months and I broke up after realizing that no matter how much we care for each other, our love language and communication style just doesn't work. I know 10 months isn't a long time and at 25, I've definitely been in longer relationships. However, this is the first time I fell so hard so fast. 

Our relationship in general was so good. We had similar hobbies and are both dorks that also take care of ourselves. There were honestly days when we just sat around and did nothing at his place and I wouldn't have traded cuddling on his couch for anything else. I've honestly never fallen in love before and I still remember when I just knew I loved him four months into our relationship. I was never the romantic type, but suddenly I wanted to celebrate relationship milestones, holidays and birthdays together. Well, my 26th birthday is on Monday and we didn't even make it that far. 

I just spent so much time with him and always looked forward to his text messages and phonecalls. Lockdown was rough, but getting to stay over at his place after isolating for 14 days alone and deciding to isolate together made me feel like this relationship was getting more serious and moving forward. Maybe this is a form of hysterical bonding, but now that life is back to normalish, we realized just how much we aren't compatible with each other. 

We broke up this morning and I cried for 2 hours before napping and then crying again. I felt a little bit better and called some friends while my sister bought me dinner. He dropped off the last of my things after work about an hour ago and I haven't stopped crying since. 

I have decided to go completely no contact. I have deleted him off of my social media accounts, removed all our messages, deleted all the pictures I have of us and put all the gifts he's given me into a box. I don't plan on ever reaching out to him again and I pray that he won't reach out to me either because it'll only make things that much harder for me. Maybe I'll be able to look at the gifts and polaroid pictures with nostalgia one day, but it's not gonna be any time soon. 

I know time will heal this pain and at the end of the day, we caught onto our incompatibility early on. I just, I miss him so much. I miss how he would hold me when I'm upset and make stupid jokes when I'm in a bad mood. I even miss the way he calls me a nerd and then me calling him a dork back. I just want this pain to stop. I wish I could just erase the last 10 months.

Update: 

It's day two and I'm trying my best to stop thinking about the ""what ifs"". I'll cry in the mornings and then feel better and have little bouts of sadness throughout the day. I still miss him, but now that I've had time to calm down I'm starting to recognize just how toxic our relationship was and how many things I ignored because I loved him so much and because of the chemistry we had so early on. He really did make me happy, but I think we brought out the worst in each other in some ways and held each other back from being better people cause we were comfortable when we were together. 

I remember him telling me that he hated how much he hurts me and that's why we should break up and I get it now. I really do and I wish I didn't go no contact so that I can tell him, but I also know that had I not gone no contact I wouldn't have been able to be so clear headed by day two. It's gonna take weeks maybe even months to move on, but I feel like I can get there.",t2_75m9vaw3,False,,0,False,Day One of Break Up and I'm Miserable,[],r/BreakUps,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ihwygl,False,dark,1.0,,public,8,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,8,,False,,1598657973.0,,[],{},,True,,1598603001.0,text,6,,,text,self.BreakUps,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So my boyfriend of 10 months and I broke up after realizing that no matter how much we care for each other, our love language and communication style just doesn&amp;#39;t work. I know 10 months isn&amp;#39;t a long time and at 25, I&amp;#39;ve definitely been in longer relationships. However, this is the first time I fell so hard so fast. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our relationship in general was so good. We had similar hobbies and are both dorks that also take care of ourselves. There were honestly days when we just sat around and did nothing at his place and I wouldn&amp;#39;t have traded cuddling on his couch for anything else. I&amp;#39;ve honestly never fallen in love before and I still remember when I just knew I loved him four months into our relationship. I was never the romantic type, but suddenly I wanted to celebrate relationship milestones, holidays and birthdays together. Well, my 26th birthday is on Monday and we didn&amp;#39;t even make it that far. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just spent so much time with him and always looked forward to his text messages and phonecalls. Lockdown was rough, but getting to stay over at his place after isolating for 14 days alone and deciding to isolate together made me feel like this relationship was getting more serious and moving forward. Maybe this is a form of hysterical bonding, but now that life is back to normalish, we realized just how much we aren&amp;#39;t compatible with each other. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We broke up this morning and I cried for 2 hours before napping and then crying again. I felt a little bit better and called some friends while my sister bought me dinner. He dropped off the last of my things after work about an hour ago and I haven&amp;#39;t stopped crying since. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have decided to go completely no contact. I have deleted him off of my social media accounts, removed all our messages, deleted all the pictures I have of us and put all the gifts he&amp;#39;s given me into a box. I don&amp;#39;t plan on ever reaching out to him again and I pray that he won&amp;#39;t reach out to me either because it&amp;#39;ll only make things that much harder for me. Maybe I&amp;#39;ll be able to look at the gifts and polaroid pictures with nostalgia one day, but it&amp;#39;s not gonna be any time soon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know time will heal this pain and at the end of the day, we caught onto our incompatibility early on. I just, I miss him so much. I miss how he would hold me when I&amp;#39;m upset and make stupid jokes when I&amp;#39;m in a bad mood. I even miss the way he calls me a nerd and then me calling him a dork back. I just want this pain to stop. I wish I could just erase the last 10 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s day two and I&amp;#39;m trying my best to stop thinking about the &amp;quot;what ifs&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;ll cry in the mornings and then feel better and have little bouts of sadness throughout the day.

,BreakUps,"Hey everyone. Really struggling with my break up and just need some support, I feel really lonely. Sorry for the long post, I wanted to get it all out. 

46 days ago, my long distance boyfriend of a year dumped me. He is 27 and I am 23. He was a gambling and marijuana addict and not the nicest at the best of times. He would borrow money a lot, even though he was working full time and I was in a part time job. We had an extremely turbulent relationship and it caused me extreme anxiety. Before the lockdown here in the UK, I was travelling to see him almost every other weekend. We did it this way because I enjoyed travelling - he lives near London which I loved - and because he worked full time whereas I was at uni and working part time. I basically lived a double life; I had my life at home, where I live with my family in a pretty dull place, worked a part time job and did uni, and then my life with him. At home I am not hugely social, I have a few close friends I see quite often but I’m not out at the pub all the time. My ex has a group of friends (and a couple of their girlfriends) and when I was there we would hang out with them a lot and go out places. While we were still together this was an issue for me because I was travelling 5 hours each way to see him and he was just taking me along when he saw his friends. I was happy with my life at home; I enjoyed uni and my job, and didn’t have a problem with the fact that my social life here isn’t too lively. 

Just before lockdown, I went to visit my ex and he broke up with me. He’s out of a job now and living with family. During the quarantine, we had the usual push and pull - him wanting me back, then dumping me again, etc. He would not speak to me for a few weeks, then come back. Eventually he just said he didn’t think he loved me anymore. Immediately after the break up, I felt so relieved and the panic attacks I had been having daily disappeared. I had obviously gotten to a point where I couldn’t cope with the stress anymore, and felt pretty fantastic and hopeful for the rest of my life. I really wasn’t that sad about it and knew it needed to happen.

In the last 3 weeks, things have changed. The biggest thing that has happened is that I have quit smoking cigarettes, which I have been doing for at least 2 years. I definitely used them as a crutch when I was struggling with anxious feelings and other emotions. Since I quit, I have had a complete meltdown over my ex and really experienced the heartbreak. I have felt so down about it, been crying a lot and feeling like he’s doing better than me and his life is better than mine, he’s got more friends, etc. I feel like my life is empty in a way - I quit my part time job a couple of months ago due to harassment, so I’m without a job, even though I’ve been desperately looking for one. I don’t drive, as I said I don’t have loads of friends and don’t go out a lot, and am just generally struggling with life. I don’t know what I want, and feel like things are never going to get better. I want to move away but I don’t have the money. I’m just really scared. I feel like I wasn’t good enough and that’s why my ex broke up with me, and now he’s gone I don’t really have much purpose. As torturous as it was, I think I stayed with him because I wanted to fix him, and of course I couldn’t, so I feel useless. Is it normal to experience all these feelings during a break up? Is it normal to feel unsatisfied with your life and so lonely? I just want to know it’s going to go away at some point. I’m lucky because I’m a really happy person usually and rarely feel dissatisfied with my life. It’s weird for me to feel like this. I feel like a loser and I’ve never thought of myself like that before.

I feel like a loser and I’ve never thought of myself like that before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR feeling lonely and empty after a break up... a month after it happened&lt;/p&gt;

My ex and I broke up almost 2 months back. She did it because she had to not because she wanted to. We both still deeply loved each other and it took a horrible toll on the both of us.

They accidentally ended up telling her the stuff that I said, she obviously got really hurt and triggered. We spoke a few weeks back, extremely hostile conversation.

And no I don't need people telling me she had someone on the side or whatever, we knew each other for years, best friends, so I do know her, her family, friends. This just doesnt seem anything like her.

September 1st will be one month since my partner (enby they/them) of a year and a half broke up with me. In many ways I feel less destroyed that I thought I would of. We both had co-dependency problems, so part of me was sure something like this would kill me if it ever happened. But it happened, and life goes on. 

But every night it still weighs on me. Every night I miss my partner, I miss how easily they made the world feel better.  They were my lover, my number one cheerleader, my best friend, and my safe space. It feels like a part of who I am is missing since they left. 

I have to grapple with the fact that they don’t believe they ever truly loved me. They told me they feel they confused needing my support with love. They told me they felt they probably Aromantic, and as time went on and as they needed less help they had come to feel their feelings for me were just being dependent on me. I have no reason to doubt them, and through out our relationship I occasionally felt my feelings for them weren’t the same as their feelings for me.

,BreakUps,"hal, I don’t know if you remember my reddit username but if you do and decided to try find my account to see what i’m up to, you’re probably reading this. 

the pain i’m feeling is unbearable. I don’t just miss my girlfriend, I miss my bestfriend who helped me through everything. this is a time where I need you the most, but its about you. ironic. 

i’ve never loved anyone as much as you. I gave you my undying attention for a year of my life and treated you with nothing but love, kindness and acceptance. I helped you through everything from your anxiety to body dysmorphia. every notification I get my heart skips a beat hoping its you. but it isn’t. and it won’t be ever again. 

I hate that you gave me false hope for the future. I lie awake at night thinking about how much you talked about us getting married someday, or having kids together. you often said how similar we are, yet broke up with me because we’re too different? well guess what, two people can be different and still be in a relationship if they love each other. it takes work and dedication. you can’t just freak out and quit when you sense that we’re too different over the course of 3 days. 

it hurts more than I can explain that you won’t even try being with me despite our differences. I thought I made you so happy that you were terrified to break up. apparently not. you say you still love me and wish it didn’t have to be like this but how can I believe that? it doesn’t have to be like this, you’re just not willing to accept me for who I am and love me despite our differences and flaws. you’re not pulling me along with you, i’m not dragging you down, you just think i’m immature and stupid, which i’m not. I often don’t think before I speak and lack common sense sometimes but that isn’t enough to be so different that it warrants breaking up over. not if you love me as much as you say you do. which is why I don’t believe you. 

I had three dreams about you last night. I cried in the shower all morning. I won’t be able to focus in work because you’re still in the very front of my mind. I can’t get you out of my head and its killing me. you don’t know what i’d do to feel your touch again or text you good morning. you’ll never know how much you hurt me. but time will heal me and you’ll realise you threw away the only person who made you this happy. you’ll realise you may find someone more ‘mature’ and ‘suited for you’ but it won’t be the same. they won’t love you like I did. they won’t have the same amount of patience. they won’t facetime you the second they sense something is wrong. you’ll realise you chose success over happiness and it’ll kill you inside because when time heals my emotional wounds and you want me back in your life because you’re lonely and miss my affection, I won’t want you back. it’ll be too late. THEN you’ll realise happiness IS success, and I wouldn’t have stopped you from achieving your goals.


‘you know I wanted you for years but its just not what I expected’

,BreakUps,"Idk, I’d say I fucked up since day one. Having never been in a relationship before I wasn’t sure I wanted to start one in the middle of my sophomore year of college. Maybe it’s not a big deal for a lot of people but it’s only been a year and a half since I moved from home where I was kept sheltered my whole life and that wasn’t nearly enough time to truly enjoy the freedom of young adult hood. I broke her heart by asking her out one drunken night and then breaking it off a few days later. 

I just needed more time but in the end it was pointless because I asked her out again a week later. After that stuff was pretty smooth sailing for a few months. We spent everyday together, and always slept together at night. Everyday without missing a beat. I guess too much too fast leads to burnout.

There were things that annoyed me, things that may have worried me but a lot of it was me being unsure about how stuff should be going or not. I’ve never been in this situation before. One day she asked me to go through my phone and unadd girls from my social media. That was our first big argument because I didn’t know how to feel about my GF wanting to inspect my social media and phone. Wasn’t hiding anything, and wasn’t talking to anyone else but I don’t know why’d she want to go through every girl on my insta.

Eventually I came to delete over 100 girls or so from my instagram that I didn’t know much but she wasn’t satisfied... ever, until our last day. She asked me to only have the girls she knew and were like super long time friends. So like 4 girls. I don’t know why, but I’ve tried explaining why it felt weird to do that at the ripe age of 20. I’m in College, in a fraternity, it just seems to me like i’m fighting the wave.


Anyways. That was only the tip of the iceberg. The real iceberg was a month later when after sex she told me she was thinking of a past orgasm. Her initial words were “i was thinking of someone else”, she later explained that she was just thinking of an orgasm she had before that felt really good because it was her first in a while at that point in her life. Either way, what I heard was what I heard and I freaked out. That was probably the worst week of my life. I said and did so many mean things, broke up so many times that week, couldn’t even look at her. My ego was broken and she was responsible. Even when I became more level headed and decided to fight forward understanding that we’re all human and it was miscommunication I made mistakes.

I texted a girl friend that was friends for a year. We used to be good friends, including other people in the friend group. I texted her asked her if she wanted to meet up so we could talk and I could ask for some advice. I realize how stupid this is now, but at the time I didn’t realize how idiotic it truly was and how it would affect my GF. I truly just wanted advice, she truly was just a friend, but none of what I did was smart. It hurts me to this day because afterwards weeks later the friend started texting me a lot more which led to my GF (well ex now i suppose) getting into a fight with her because she saw things I didn’t see. And she was probably right. I fucked up.


After she told me about what she was thinking, after that terrible week things weren’t ever the same. For the first time in the relationship my actions weren’t led by love and compassion. They were led by revenge, anger, hurt. Constant picking fights. Constant annoyed. It truly was so messy. It never really recovered either. We’d go on beach trips, she’d rent a hotel for us there, we’d have really good nights and days but the weeks were bad. Id pick petty fights and got really insecure for a while. It all took a toll in the relationship.

This attitude lasted a lot of the summer. It slowly started to fade mid summer but the repercussions of my actions started to come into effect. We’d fight like everyday. I’d be annoyed and couldn’t stand stuff she’d do. We’d breakup and then I’d feel terrible and want her back right after. 

I miss her a lot. But more than anything I wish I wouldn’t have let that iceberg completely switch the tides of the relationship. We had a date night a few nights after our 6 months and went to a really fancy restaurant. Really loving feel to it. Very romantic. Then I went to a party afterwards and we got into a fight. I feel so stupid for ending a romantic date at a friends kickback that wasn’t even fun. Ultimately just ruined what would’ve been an amazing date.

We got past that. But as this month has been found a lot of things have been stressing me out. A lot of her decisions have been stressing me as well. A lot of arguing. She cried a few days ago because after a lot of nights not seeing her, when we used to spend every night together, I wanted to go to my friends place. I was annoyed that she asked me to stay with her. To spend time with her. I made a fit because I already had plans. She balled, she felt like I hated her and honestly I don’t think I would’ve had any different interpretation if I were her. The last month I spent so much more time at night with my friends than with her. Slowly fading away. I wanted to see my friends. I wanted to be able to smoke every night and catch up and have fun. I didn’t want to stay in and watch netflix again every night. 

I guess spending so much time together really wasn’t the best idea. I became tired of it, and at the end would escape from it when I could. I ditched her on 4th of July, well not really but after BBQ with her family we got in a fight and she didn’t want to come to my friends get together. I called out of work to go to the river with long distance friends on the day she was moving out. 

I just did a lot of things I wanted to do. With not much thought about her and what she needed. I feel terrible about it now, and even during it. Regardless if we would’ve broken up the same time and way, i wish i could go back and slap myself for a lot of the fuckups i made.

She tried reconciling with me today. So we can get back together and start off right in a better foot. But as she’s moving to a different city an hour away, and i’m moving into my frat house, and her demands of no girls on instagram and let her check up on my phone. along with all the other problems she’s had with her family. stress and money. i wasn’t sure i could handle it and so it ended. Asked her if I could remain in her life and she’s said it was best not to 

Started packing my stuff to move out today and took a look at the wall. A pin holding our first photo booth sheet. A few weeks into dating. My smile. Her smile. Her hair. Her being happy. I hate the fact that I ever made her unhappy, sad, felt unwanted. But I know I’m on a different page of life, our lifestyles aren’t really compatible without one of us really sacrificing a majority. I wish I could just go back in time and fix my fuck ups, the major ones at least. Or at least redeem myself but there’s really no way of doing that besides getting back together. I’m too afraid to come back to square one if that happened. I’m too afraid of breaking her heart again.

&lt;p&gt;I just did a lot of things I wanted to do. With not much thought about her and what she needed. I feel terrible about it now, and even during it. Regardless if we would’ve broken up the same time and way, i wish i could go back and slap myself for a lot of the fuckups i made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She tried reconciling with me today. So we can get back together and start off right in a better foot. But as she’s moving to a different city an hour away, and i’m moving into my frat house, and her demands of no girls on instagram and let her check up on my phone. along with all the other problems she’s had with her family. stress and money. i wasn’t sure i could handle it and so it ended. Asked her if I could remain in her life and she’s said it was best not to &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Started packing my stuff to move out today and took a look at the wall. A pin holding our first photo booth sheet. A few weeks into dating. My smile. Her smile. Her hair. Her being happy. I hate the fact that I ever made her unhappy, sad, felt unwanted. But I know I’m on a different page of life, our lifestyles aren’t really compatible without one of us really sacrificing a majority. I wish I could just go back in time and fix my fuck ups, the major ones at least. Or at least redeem myself but there’s really no way of doing that besides getting back together. I’m too afraid to come back to square one if that happened. I’m too afraid of breaking her heart again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to let her know how much I love her.&lt;/p&gt;

,BreakUps,"I (f20) know there are endless posts like this, but it really does get better. This will be pretty lengthy, so I get it if no one wants to read it. 

She (f19) was my first love, and I didn't realize how she gaslit and manipulated me from the beginning. It was a long distance relationship, we lived 14 hours apart and I'd always talk about us finally meeting. Her mom was more than willing to drive them to visit, but she would always make excuses or ask her mom too late, like 3 days before Christmas when plans were already made.

She would scream, call me names, her favorite was to call me stupid or ask how dumb/retarded I was because she knew I was insecure about my intelligence.  She lied about being bisexual the entire time, although she knew I didn't care. Turns out she was cheating on me and sexting guys she met playing video games on PlayStation. 

I can go on and on about how abusive and manipulative she was, but honestly, I don't want to. This is the most I've talked about her since our would-be anniversary in January, aside from helping friends with advice and telling them how I could relate to their love issues cause of things my ex did. 

It does get better. Once upon a time I would have given her everything and loved her forever. I broke myself over and over to try and make her happy, and it never worked, only made things worse. I'd have panic attacks when I'd imagine us being apart, and when we broke up for good, I couldn't eat or sleep. Not to mention I completely lost myself to this relationship. I was a genuinely good and kind person before all this. Best friends with my mom, going out of my way to be nice to everyone. And now I'm still trying to stop being so bitter and mean by default. I hate that in myself, but I'm grateful I have this opportunity to be a better person. I know she was making me worse, and I would never be able to get better if I was around her.

I want you all to know she isn't even a thought I have in my head. I don't care about her. Memories aren't bittersweet, I'm plainly indifferent about the best and worst times between us. I simply and truly do not care anymore. I never thought I would get here, but I'm so happy I am. And you can and will get to this point too.

We last talked September 2019. In Novemeber I met a woman (28f) at my mom's friend's house, the friend had a younger roommate and the woman was his girlfriend. She was stunning. We saw eachother frequently, but never said more than ""Hey"" or ""Goodnight"" when she would spend every other weekend there.

By December her boyfriend had gotten caught shoplifting, went to jail, and when he got out on New Years Day she took him to rehab upstate. My brother and I rode with her to keep her company during the drive back. The 3 hours back we did nothing but talk and get to know eachother. She was amazing and we had a lot in common, like having OCD, depression and anxiety, to having the exact same music taste and sense of humor, having the same religious/political views, the same moral values and outlooks on love, sex and relationships. 

She is the polar opposite of her boyfriend;  amazing job (he was jobless and relied on her for everything, food, drugs, rides), very close familial relationships (his family didn't talk to him), the biggest and kindest heart I've seen, and she was so so outgoing and giving. She would frequently buy homeless people dog food, drinks, fast food and cigarettes and go out of her way to care for others. He would scream and berate and threaten her, even make her fear for her life, and has been cheating on her the whole time while stealing money (racking up over $12k in credit card debt before she realized), stealing and totaling 2 cars, and so on.

We became best friends really quickly, and in Febuary I moved in with her in her mom's house where she also lived with her 7 year old son that she had with her ex husband. 

I quickly learned that her dad was always absent and he only wanted her as a sort of 'prop' to better his image. Her only serious relationship was with her ex husband, who was an abusive drunk who beat her among other things. She divorced him to be with her current addict abuser boyfriend. It was obvious her father and ex were the only examples of relationships she had, she was doomed love-wise from the beginning. 

I got feelings for her right off the bat, and she did too. We slept in her bed, snuggled, slow danced in the kitchen, went everywhere and did everything together. We even went out to eat on Valentine's Day together. I was truly in love, but she told me she didn't have feelings. It was obvious she did but I went along because I knew she wasn't ready to face her sexuality. We came close to kissing a few times, and I could always see her love for me when she looked at me or talked about me. She would frequently tell me how she isn't used to love like mine; I'd carry in the groceries, cook her breakfast in bed, get up early and make her coffee to drink while she got ready for work and also make her lunch, make sure she'd take her antidepressants, spontaneously pick her bouquets of wildflowers, and more. I know I loved her really well, it showed. She was so purely happy. How she was able to convince herself it was platonic, I will never know. 

In April he got out of rehab and relapsed. He came back into town, and she stopped taking her antidepressants. The difference in her was like night and day. She pulled her hair more (trichotillomania), bit her nails off, stopped eating, and let him walk all over her without a word. He demanded we stop talking. She would sneak and call or email me. After a month she finally got rid of him again, but not before he stole from her mom, ruined her relationship with her family, totaled her car and got her fired from her job. 

They are still together. After we got back to normal (he ""unwillingly allowed her to talk to me again"") I told her i understood why she acted the way she did and everything, but if she ever treated me like that again we couldn't be friends. 

Fast forward to today, we haven't lived together for a month and a half. She never started taking her medication again. She seemed to just stop caring about us. The rift between us got bigger over time. She hasn't opened my messages in 2 weeks, when before we would talk every day from ""Goodmorning sunshine 😊"" to ""Goodnight, sweet dreams!"" I have a feeling it was one of her boyfriends ""conditions"" to go back to rehab, but the fact is that he has been using hard drugs since he was 16 and he is 29 now and only goes to rehab to get the ones in his life who pay his way to stick around holding out hope for someone who will never change. 

I understand why she isn't talking to me. It is not okay, but I was there. I learned a lot of lessons from my ex, and so I get doing anything for your partner. But she is losing a good thing by doing this. I've not pushed or pried, when I realized she was purposefully ignoring me, I stepped back. So much has happened in the past 2 weeks she has no idea about and doesn't care enough to ""break a rule"" and check on me. But it's out of my control. I'm letting her go. Whatever happens, happens.

And so I realize, instead of spending 3 years waiting on her to see what's good for her and choosing me like I did with my ex, I only spent 8 months this time. This is definitely not an ideal situation, but I'm not forcing things. I'm healthier. I'm better, and that's mostly to my friend's credit because she made me want to be a better person. I'm realizing that love is never something you force or pray and beg for. If it's meant for you then you will know. 

So, I want to leave anyone who read this far with a few of my favorite quotes that help remind me of my worth, that will hopefully remind you as well. You deserve the love you dream about, with someone who will love you like you love them, from the start.  

""Your self respect always has to be stronger than your feelings, or it'll get you every time."" -unknown

""You can't heal in the same environment that broke you.""  -unknown

""You can't control other's actions, but you can control your reactions."" -my mom

I want to thank anyone who read this, and if somehow you helped me get through my break up a year ago, thank you too. Life is crazy and full of so many highs and lows.

,BreakUps," ever since we broke up it’s like I’ve just been paralyzed whenever I think about her, like I can’t do anything. I get this pit feeling in my chest of a collection of sadness, anger, jealousy, etc. And I let my mind wander into some bad places that feed those emotions. And ik it’s kinda cliche, but literally everything reminds me of her. and I get stuck in those thoughts of past memories and that really fucks me up. It was my first serious relationship (8 months) and this is my first ever serious breakup so I didn’t really know what to prepare for.

,BreakUps,"I am 5 months into my breakup. It was sudden, quite unexpected, and traumatic.

I haven't seen my ex since the day we broke up. It was a complete and brutal cut-off - blocked and ghosted. It was as if she had died.

The relationship wasn't perfect and I made mistakes that contributed heavily to the breakup. This is a regret that I have had to learn to live with. I'm not one of those guys who pretends that ""I did everything right and she still left me"". No. I made mistakes, and my ex had every right to leave me. I tried to make amends for my mistakes and thought I had made progress and re-built trust, but it was too late. Love can't be negotiated. It takes 2 people to form a loving relationship, and she made a decision that her future wasn't to include me in it.

My healing process has been long and hard. I am not fully-recovered, but I have made some progress after many months of being stuck in pain and sorrow.

Here are some lessons I have learned during my healing process;

1. I went through an extended period of ""denial"" - I thought my ex would change her mind. I truly believed it. I thought it would definitely happen, and all I had to do was wait for her to realise that she had made a mistake. If she was allowed to experience life without me for a while, she would decide that the grass wasn't greener, and she would return.
2. As time went on (months), and she displayed absolutely no signs of coming back, I deluded myself further by convincing myself that I had to pursue her and show her that the relationship was worth saving.
3. Pursuing her and briefly re-establishing contact with her via a phone call made me realise, starkly, that she was ""gone"" emotionally. She had moved on and had no interest whatsoever in getting back together, or even meeting for a coffee. I deluded myself further by convincing myself that she was just putting up a strong ""front"" to show me that she was a strong person and strong in her decision.
4. I cycled between delusions until the reality of my situation kept hitting me. The decision had been made by her long ago. She was done. Her decision was final. All I was doing now was robbing from my own future by waiting for her feelings to return. I was waiting in an empty desert for rain that would never come, and I was slowly dying of thirst.
5. Logic hit me - why would someone breakup with me if they wanted to be with me? That makes no sense, and my delusions slowly became clear to me. I had been protecting my ego from fully experiencing the ""loss"". I was a coward who wasn't facing the reality of what had happened. I couldn't bring myself to imagine my life without her because it would mean that I would have to venture forward in my life alone and try to find love again (with no guarantees that I would find it).
6. My process of coming to terms with reality has taken several week and is on-going. It's a battle between my ego and the truth. My ego doesn't want to believe that a person I love doesn't want me, but the truth keeps breaking through the ego and speaks to me clearly ""she's gone, and she isn't coming back.""
7. Holding onto hope of her return became toxic. It was exhausting. It clouds the future and prevents me from experiencing the New when there's a constant. festering idea that she will come back to me one day. It's a limbo of torture.
8. Acknowledging my reality is slowly helping me to embrace my new life without her. This is not easy. The inner eye wants to turn backwards and watch highlight reels and re-runs of the memories with her. It keeps the dream of the relationship alive, but it stops me from being fully-present in the here and now. I was living in the past, which had become a lonely dream where I had tried to create an image of my ex who still loved me. We would walk together, hand in hand, through blurry landscapes. I would snap out of these dreams and the weight of my alone-ness would come crashing down all around me.
9. I have come to realise that Time Does Not Heal unless I am able to acknowledge reality and escape from the dreams of being with her. Lying to  myself about what has really happened caused persistent and deepening depression. Worthlessness, powerlessness and self-loathing that I couldn't make my dreams with her a reality. I'd had my time with her, and that time was now gone.
10. The key to beginning the process of moving on has been to let go of the hope that I will ever be with her again. I'm now facing the very likely possibility that I will never even see her again. I'm drinking it in. Facing it. Feeling the pain and the loss.

You cut me off the day after you dumped me, as though I didn't deserve to be heard, as though I had no say in our relationship, as though I didn't deserve one last conversation or to talk things through.

It's like you didn't remember the part you had played in imagining our future together, when you said that you didn't see a future with me. It's like you forgot that you told me that you loved me everyday. That we shared a bed together. That you were the closest person to me. You made me believe in you and in love. You were leading me on for so long.

You couldn't face my feelings or the fallout after breaking up with me. You put up a wall under the guise of boundaries. You shut me out, like all matters to do with emotions when they get too complicated. You discarded me and wiped your hands clean of the mess you abandoned. 

Didn't I deserve to know why I had been blindsided? Didn't I deserve to talk it through with you and discuss solutions? Couldn't we have tried to fix things? What was so terrible about our relationship or ability to communicate that you had to cut contact straight away? Did I mean so little to you? How could our feelings have been so disconnected, and how could you let me continue to fall in love with you so deeply, while hiding your own detachment? This was practically a ghost after a year of sharing our lives together.

What you did - it wasn't respectful. It wasn't decent. Being blindsided by a breakup causes people to be scared of ever trusting and letting someone in again. I don't want to make the same heartbreaking mistake of being so blindly in love with someone ever again.

What's worse is, being blocked by you the day after breaking up with me took away my power and choice. How about having faith in people to act with maturity and give each other space? Or how about maturely talking it out so we can continue to have a positive regard for each other, even if we can't be together? Why did I let you get away with breaking my heart, with letting this relationship fall apart, and with determining that everything would end on your terms?

Are you proud of the way you ended it? Are you happy with how you ripped off the bandaid? Because there is still a huge gaping and exposed wound over here.

This is not how I would end a relationship where two people were good to each other. I don't want to think about how somewhere in this world, there is a guy who I once loved, but can never speak to again because he doesn't have the guts to face me, to face what he did, and have an honest conversation after breaking my heart.

,BreakUps,"First of all I just want to say a huge thank you to those people who hang around here and offer their words and support to people who are going through the lowest emotions that it's possible for a human being to feel. For me, just lurking and reading this sub over the past three months has done more for me than any expensive therapy sessions ever could. Your efforts are more invaluable than you know. 


My 4 and a half year relationship ended abruptly at the end of May due to her rampant infidelity. I went through the same range of emotions as many here are currently feeling or have felt. The initial desperate begging stage, the crushingly depressed stage, the anger stage, the self hate, the insomnia (oh fuck me, the insomnia!!), all of it. I was in a pit. I had to take 3 weeks off work. I was drinking very heavily. All I could think about was her and how I'll never be happy ever again. The thought of her being with someone else was like having a broken bottle repeatedly stabbed into my stomach and my chest and then salt thrown into the wound. How could she move on so quickly after we spent so long and worked so hard building an amazing life? How could she just abandon all the plans we made? 


Something that gets written here a lot is ""You won't feel like this forever, it will get better, I promise."" Did I believe that the first time I read it? The tenth time? The hundredth time? Did I fuck! Another thing written a lot is ""You aren't in love with the person you lost, that person doesn't exist. You're in love with the dream you created with that person."" Did I believe that either? Nope! Trust me though, these things are repeated here a lot FOR A REASON. One more thing is ""GO NO CONTACT"". Do it. It'll feel impossible at times, especially in the first weeks as you're painfully adjusting to not being in their inbox all day and not getting the good morning and goodnight messages, but fucking do it. If you contact them, it'll throw you back into the middle of the black hole. You will not feel better. Do not contact them. If you can't bring yourself to block them off social media just yet then fine, but put them on restricted, keep your life off social media for a bit, do NOT give a running commentary on your life hoping they'll see it. They do not give a single flying fuck about you.

So what did I do? Well, I got sick of moping about my house feeling like the world was caving in on me so I started reaching out to my friends. If you're going through a breakup then please do not underestimate just how fucking valuable your friends are to you. I made some plans with them even though I didn't want to. I didn't want to shower and change out of the clothes I'd been wearing for 10 days. I didn't feel like seeing anyone or doing anything, but damnit I was fucked if I was going to let my idiotic feelings keep me nailed to the ground. I bit the bullet and went out anyway. Fake it 'til you make it applies strongly in these situations. That was the first step of the recovery. I cannot tell you how much socialising with good people will help you out. If you can momentarily forget what you're going through and maybe even laugh, it'll be the best thing you ever did. Did I go home and get hit back in the face with my reality and find myself back in a pit? Oh God yes. But I got some sleep that night. 

In the weeks following, I was determined to fill any free time I had with doing SOMETHING. I bought a bike and went out riding either before or after work. You've probably heard people saying that exercise induces happy endorphins, they're right. Do you feel like doing a workout right now? I bet you don't, I didn't, but I did it anyway. Fake it 'til you make it! On my days off I continued to make plans with my friends. If my friends were busy then I'd make plans with my family. When's the last time you took your parents or grandparents out for dinner? Do it! You'll have a great evening. Get shitfaced with your brother or sister! Find SOMETHING.

As a result of being determined to make plans, I can honestly say I've had some of the best times I've had in many many years.  I've met some great new people, I've reconnected with old friends.  I've had experiences that I would never have had if my relationship had still been a thing. That's the key I think. The daily happiness you found with your significant other is gone and that's why you feel like a bag of shit. You're going through a drug like withdrawal, you're a rattling junkie. Replace that happiness with other happiness, even if it's not as good or not the same, do it anyway. Eventually it will be. Adapt or die. Don't be Blockbuster or Blackberry. You've probably seen a load of people here say ""If you can't find happiness in yourself then you'll never find happiness with someone else"". You might not believe it, or you might think ""well how the fuck can I do that when he/she was my source of happiness??"", I certainly did, but start taking the same steps as I did and you'll see. 

As a result of me 'faking it until I made it', I feel like I have now started to actually make it. I've met someone new and it's really early days and I'm not expecting anything, but I met her as a result of me being happy and confident and looking forward to my future. If I never met her then I'd still feel like I 'made it'. What do I feel about my ex? Literally nothing. She's just someone I used to know. I wish her all the best in her journey, and I'm quite frankly delighted that she's not coming on mine with me anymore. I'm going on a far more exciting journey to a better place. I'm telling you that you can do the same. Do you believe me? Of course you don't. I wouldn't have believed me either.

,BreakUps,"Hey guys, I need your opinion and advice. I'll try to narrow it down as good as possible, but it's probably gonna be a long read anyway. I appreciate each and everyone who reads this and am grateful for any helpful comments and thoughts regarding the breakup and the meet up.

So, my girlfriend (F22) dumped me (M25) 3 months ago out of the blue. We've been together for 7 years, have been living together for the past 4 years and were each other's firsts. She has already been in Sicily for 3 months for her Erasmus semester when she ended it and it's already been going downhill when she got there (had some fights because she wouldn't wanna return even though public restrictions in Italy got worse due to covid). 
A couple of days prior to the breakup I noticed her pulling away. When I asked whether something was wrong, she told me that she had been thinking about us a lot and that she'd like to talk the day after. By then, I somehow knew she was going to break up with me and my natural response to that was being angry and needy at her for silently pulling away instead of talking to me like we always used to whenever something was off. Needless to say, she ignored most of it and we set a time for our talk.
 
She eventually ended it via videocall and told me that she thinks that she doesn't believe us to be as compatible anymore and that she feels like being in a relationship with me hinders her from achieving her personal self-fulfillment and growth (which is complete BS imho) because I was ""too much of an influence"". She allegedly wanted to become a strong and independent woman and learn to make decisions on her own, but feels like she can't in a relationship. To this day, I don't think this is true at all, but just some made up BS excuse to provide at least some reason for her decision. When I asked her whether she had cheated on me with her roommate, she assured me that she hadn't. I told her that she couldn't just leave me like this after 7 years and basically refused to accept such a disrespectful breakup. I cried, begged and pleaded her to stay and even thought about finding a way to go to Sicily to see her (which was impossible thanks to covid). In a second call she got really angry with me, threatened to block me if I kept texting her (eventually she never did, neither did I) and told me not to jump onto the next girl right away, hoping she could save me (whatever that was supposed to mean).

Not even 12 hours later she texts me how she regrets breaking up and that she doesn't know what's wrong with her. She tells me how much she loves me and how afraid she is of losing me, but that she just doesn't understand why she's having doubts. Then she broke up again (yep). The next night, she texted me at 3 am, telling me again how she regrets it and that she loves me and how sorry she is. She wanted me to give her time to think about everything. I really tried, but I just couldn't stand it because it still felt like a breakup after all. It was basically self-torture because our relationship was hanging by a threat and she kept me hooked. So, one night, one of my friends came over because I couldn't take it anymore and as he found me crying on the floor in our flat, he suggested I should give her a set deadline for her final decision in order to end my suffering. I texted her that I wanted her to make a decision and two days later, she broke up with me for good by letter via WhatsApp. She was again just trying to give reasons for her decision by saying how we were still children when we got together, how we needed each other and how much we've changed as people. It also said that she doesn't know whether or not she's fallen in love with her roommate (which doesn't surprise me at all, considering they took a few walks to the beach at night together - I know, emotional cheating, huge red flag!). 
After she sent me that farewell letter, I did some things that I'm not proud of, like calling her names, sending her family the letter she's sent me and badmouthing. I know it was wrong, but I didn't know how to deal with the amount of pain she's caused me and I think this actually hurt me more than her. 

So I found TLC, Dating Guy and Coach Lee on Youtube and started NC. I thought to have found all the answers and was convinced that she had GIGS. Every once in a while she would reach out to me asking me how I was and how I was doing with my graduation paper. 3 weeks into the breakup, she changed her relationship status on Facebook to single and put the  pictures of us on private. Another week later (1 month post-BU), I found out in a phone call with her that she's in a relationship with her roommate now. I still don't know if it was only her GIGS or if he was her rebound or if she monkey-branched. I told her how pathetic it is that she can't even live with the consequences of her own decision (apart from having lied to me for the reasons to break up) and that this has nothing to do with the independence and strength she was looking for. I also told her how much I loved her and that she'll never find anybody else who will love her as much as I have. It killed me from the inside to learn about this, but I knew he was just a shadow of what I was and meant to her; and besides, it's not his fault anyway. So I stayed relatively calm, asked her to stop texting me until she returns except for organizational matters and continued NC.

Of course she would keep contacting me for stupid things, like wishing me well with my new place (like I just moved places for fun) or other random stuff. I never ignored her texts, neither did I engage too much most of the time. A few weeks later, her aunt told me how much she had cried after our last call after I've told her how much I loved her. This was a major setback in my healing process, so I decided not to text her aunt anymore.

2,5 months into the breakup, I deleted her from my socials, even though I managed not to stalk her anymore at some point. I'm keeping her number and haven't deleted any pictures of us (probably not ever going to because it feels like deleting the past 7 years of my life, which is a lot considering my age). The day after I deleted her from my socials, I sent her a picture of her mail she asked me to send. She thanked me and immediately told me that she ""coincidentally"" noticed that I deleted her and how she thinks what a shame it was. I told her that it wasn't easy for me to do, but that I didn't see any point in it. She offered friendship again and told me I could re-add her to my socials whenever I wanted to, but I declined like all the other times she offered it. It all went down to her saying how different we looked at things to which I replied that I couldn't agree more with her because I'm the kind of person that wants to work on things that are about to fall apart, while she seems to be the kind of person that just throws broken things away and replaces them. This apparently triggered her so hard that she responded with an almost 4min long voice message in which she told me how badly I've treated her since she's been gone (which is not true) and that she hasn't done anything wrong. So she was basically just re-telling her BS letter and telling me how I'm to blame for the breakup. Funny thing is, she didn't even know what to say, couldn't finish most of her sentences properly and at one point her voice broke down. I'm pretty sure she's started realizing that she fucked up, but keeps telling herself and me lies that she hasn't. Must be some kind of self-protection mechanism. I responded to her voice message with a few voice messages myself, but she didn't reply to a single thing I told her and just brushed it off like ""Aight, not gonna comment on this. Let's just leave it at that."". Her ignorance and lack of accountability got me so angry that I texted her an hour later. I told her how ridiculous she was for acting all mature, while being unable to respond to any of the things I told her. How narrow-minded and ignorant she was for blaming ME for everything, even though she broke up with me from a 2000km distance to fuck some Italian dude she barely even knows. I told her that we could have one last talk to settle things with our old flat and that I never wanna see her again afterwards. I regretted it pretty quickly and was ashamed of openly showing her that she still affects my emotional state. She replied the next day ""Okay, if you so say so. I still wish you all the best."" and I asked her again to stop contacting me unless she had something reasonable to contribute to a conversation. 

A lot has happened in the meantime: I moved to a place of my own, have been working a lot to earn money in order to buy stuff for my new place while still being busy finishing my bachelor's paper, been hitting the gym twice as much as usual and picked up my guitar again.

Now, here's the deal: She'll be back this Friday (tomorrow) and asked me a few days ago to give the keys to her cousin, i.e. we won't see each other immediately and I assume it's because she is afraid of seeing me. However, when I met her cousin to hand the keys over, she told me that my ex does wanna meet up with me, but at some later point in time. Could be in a week, could be in a month. I don't know when and most importantly why she wants to meet up. I think she either just wants to settle things with our old flat or she wants to ""give me closure"", even though I stopped asking for it eventually. 
Here's my question: How should I act when we meet up? I'm still hurting and I do still love her, but I don't want her back anymore (at least not the way she is now), so there's no need for me to act a certain way ""to get her back"" like all the Youtubers I've been watching suggest. I just wanna deal with this the most mature way possible and show her that I'm well able to properly talk to her without losing it and that I don't need her in my life to be happy. 
IF she starts talking about us and the breakup when we meet up, how open and honest should I be about how and what I think and feel?

&lt;p&gt;So, my girlfriend (F22) dumped me (M25) 3 months ago out of the blue. We&amp;#39;ve been together for 7 years, have been living together for the past 4 years and were each other&amp;#39;s firsts. She has already been in Sicily for 3 months for her Erasmus semester when she ended it and it&amp;#39;s already been going downhill when she got there (had some fights because she wouldn&amp;#39;t wanna return even though public restrictions in Italy got worse due to covid). 
A couple of days prior to the breakup I noticed her pulling away. When I asked whether something was wrong, she told me that she had been thinking about us a lot and that she&amp;#39;d like to talk the day after. By then, I somehow knew she was going to break up with me and my natural response to that was being angry and needy at her for silently pulling away instead of talking to me like we always used to whenever something was off. Needless to say, she ignored most of it and we set a time for our talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She eventually ended it via videocall and told me that she thinks that she doesn&amp;#39;t believe us to be as compatible anymore and that she feels like being in a relationship with me hinders her from achieving her personal self-fulfillment and growth (which is complete BS imho) because I was &amp;quot;too much of an influence&amp;quot;. She allegedly wanted to become a strong and independent woman and learn to make decisions on her own, but feels like she can&amp;#39;t in a relationship. To this day, I don&amp;#39;t think this is true at all, but just some made up BS excuse to provide at least some reason for her decision. When I asked her whether she had cheated on me with her roommate, she assured me that she hadn&amp;#39;t. I told her that she couldn&amp;#39;t just leave me like this after 7 years and basically refused to accept such a disrespectful breakup. I cried, begged and pleaded her to stay and even thought about finding a way to go to Sicily to see her (which was impossible thanks to covid). In a second call she got really angry with me, threatened to block me if I kept texting her (eventually she never did, neither did I) and told me not to jump onto the next girl right away, hoping she could save me (whatever that was supposed to mean).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not even 12 hours later she texts me how she regrets breaking up and that she doesn&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s wrong with her. She tells me how much she loves me and how afraid she is of losing me, but that she just doesn&amp;#39;t understand why she&amp;#39;s having doubts. Then she broke up again (yep). The next night, she texted me at 3 am, telling me again how she regrets it and that she loves me and how sorry she is. She wanted me to give her time to think about everything. I really tried, but I just couldn&amp;#39;t stand it because it still felt like a breakup after all. It was basically self-torture because our relationship was hanging by a threat and she kept me hooked. So, one night, one of my friends came over because I couldn&amp;#39;t take it anymore and as he found me crying on the floor in our flat, he suggested I should give her a set deadline for her final decision in order to end my suffering. I texted her that I wanted her to make a decision and two days later, she broke up with me for good by letter via WhatsApp. She was again just trying to give reasons for her decision by saying how we were still children when we got together, how we needed each other and how much we&amp;#39;ve changed as people. It also said that she doesn&amp;#39;t know whether or not she&amp;#39;s fallen in love with her roommate (which doesn&amp;#39;t surprise me at all, considering they took a few walks to the beach at night together - I know, emotional cheating, huge red flag!). 
After she sent me that farewell letter, I did some things that I&amp;#39;m not proud of, like calling her names, sending her family the letter she&amp;#39;s sent me and badmouthing. I know it was wrong, but I didn&amp;#39;t know how to deal with the amount of pain she&amp;#39;s caused me and I think this actually hurt me more than her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I found TLC, Dating Guy and Coach Lee on Youtube and started NC. I thought to have found all the answers and was convinced that she had GIGS. Every once in a while she would reach out to me asking me how I was and how I was doing with my graduation paper. 3 weeks into the breakup, she changed her relationship status on Facebook to single and put the  pictures of us on private. Another week later (1 month post-BU), I found out in a phone call with her that she&amp;#39;s in a relationship with her roommate now. I still don&amp;#39;t know if it was only her GIGS or if he was her rebound or if she monkey-branched. I told her how pathetic it is that she can&amp;#39;t even live with the consequences of her own decision (apart from having lied to me for the reasons to break up) and that this has nothing to do with the independence and strength she was looking for. I also told her how much I loved her and that she&amp;#39;ll never find anybody else who will love her as much as I have. It killed me from the inside to learn about this, but I knew he was just a shadow of what I was and meant to her; and besides, it&amp;#39;s not his fault anyway. So I stayed relatively calm, asked her to stop texting me until she returns except for organizational matters and continued NC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course she would keep contacting me for stupid things, like wishing me well with my new place (like I just moved places for fun) or other random stuff. I never ignored her texts, neither did I engage too much most of the time. A few weeks later, her aunt told me how much she had cried after our last call after I&amp;#39;ve told her how much I loved her. This was a major setback in my healing process, so I decided not to text her aunt anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2,5 months into the breakup, I deleted her from my socials, even though I managed not to stalk her anymore at some point. I&amp;#39;m keeping her number and haven&amp;#39;t deleted any pictures of us (probably not ever going to because it feels like deleting the past 7 years of my life, which is a lot considering my age). The day after I deleted her from my socials, I sent her a picture of her mail she asked me to send. She thanked me and immediately told me that she &amp;quot;coincidentally&amp;quot; noticed that I deleted her and how she thinks what a shame it was. I told her that it wasn&amp;#39;t easy for me to do, but that I didn&amp;#39;t see any point in it. She offered friendship again and told me I could re-add her to my socials whenever I wanted to, but I declined like all the other times she offered it. It all went down to her saying how different we looked at things to which I replied that I couldn&amp;#39;t agree more with her because I&amp;#39;m the kind of person that wants to work on things that are about to fall apart, while she seems to be the kind of person that just throws broken things away and replaces them. This apparently triggered her so hard that she responded with an almost 4min long voice message in which she told me how badly I&amp;#39;ve treated her since she&amp;#39;s been gone (which is not true) and that she hasn&amp;#39;t done anything wrong. So she was basically just re-telling her BS letter and telling me how I&amp;#39;m to blame for the breakup. Funny thing is, she didn&amp;#39;t even know what to say, couldn&amp;#39;t finish most of her sentences properly and at one point her voice broke down. I&amp;#39;m pretty sure she&amp;#39;s started realizing that she fucked up, but keeps telling herself and me lies that she hasn&amp;#39;t. Must be some kind of self-protection mechanism. I responded to her voice message with a few voice messages myself, but she didn&amp;#39;t reply to a single thing I told her and just brushed it off like &amp;quot;Aight, not gonna comment on this. Let&amp;#39;s just leave it at that.&amp;quot;. Her ignorance and lack of accountability got me so angry that I texted her an hour later. I told her how ridiculous she was for acting all mature, while being unable to respond to any of the things I told her. How narrow-minded and ignorant she was for blaming ME for everything, even though she broke up with me from a 2000km distance to fuck some Italian dude she barely even knows. I told her that we could have one last talk to settle things with our old flat and that I never wanna see her again afterwards. I regretted it pretty quickly and was ashamed of openly showing her that she still affects my emotional state. She replied the next day &amp;quot;Okay, if you so say so. I still wish you all the best.&amp;quot; and I asked her again to stop contacting me unless she had something reasonable to contribute to a conversation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot has happened in the meantime: I moved to a place of my own, have been working a lot to earn money in order to buy stuff for my new place while still being busy finishing my bachelor&amp;#39;s paper, been hitting the gym twice as much as usual and picked up my guitar again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, here&amp;#39;s the deal: She&amp;#39;ll be back this Friday (tomorrow) and asked me a few days ago to give the keys to her cousin, i.e. we won&amp;#39;t see each other immediately and I assume it&amp;#39;s because she is afraid of seeing me. However, when I met her cousin to hand the keys over, she told me that my ex does wanna meet up with me, but at some later point in time. Could be in a week, could be in a month. I don&amp;#39;t know when and most importantly why she wants to meet up. I think she either just wants to settle things with our old flat or she wants to &amp;quot;give me closure&amp;quot;, even though I stopped asking for it eventually. 
Here&amp;#39;s my question: How should I act when we meet up? I&amp;#39;m still hurting and I do still love her, but I don&amp;#39;t want her back anymore (at least not the way she is now), so there&amp;#39;s no need for me to act a certain way &amp;quot;to get her back&amp;quot; like all the Youtubers I&amp;#39;ve been watching suggest. I just wanna deal with this the most mature way possible and show her that I&amp;#39;m well able to properly talk to her without losing it and that I don&amp;#39;t need her in my life to be happy. 
IF she starts talking about us and the breakup when we meet up, how open and honest should I be about how and what I think and feel? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR
GF broke up long distance while doing Erasmus 
Apparently lied to me about the reasons for breaking up 
Started a relationship with her roommate 1 month later 
Ex returns tomorrow and wants to meet up soon 
How should I act and behave when we meet up?&lt;/p&gt;

,BreakUps,"Something that I really dislike about most breakup songs is that the the overall message seems to be one of animosity towards the dumper. They're angry, or bitter, or vindictive, and the message they seem to send is that the person who dumped them made a horrible mistake and they should be punished for it.

My breakup a couple of weeks ago was with my girlfriend of 5 years. We had lived together for a really long time, but ultimately we couldn't work some long-standing issues out. When she left me I was (am still am) completely heartbroken, but our breakup was really tender and compassionate. I remember when she left, we kissed for the last time, and we wished each other all the best in our lives moving forwards. I'm sure that one day when we're ready we'll be friends again, but it's been a hard couple of weeks for me.

We both had an honest and healthy relationship through out the almost 2 years that we were together. I've actually never had such a good relationship with someone until I met him. When we first got together, we had told each other that we both wanted something serious because that was what we both wanted to we both went for it and I was so happy that he made it so easy for me to fall in love with him and he told me that he felt the same about me too and how he had never felt like this with anyone before. Then this whole quarantine thing happened and we weren't able to see each other much due to him working in the medical field but we both had said that we would still make some time for each other and we did.

I had enough I said &amp;quot;no more&amp;quot;. My heart is broken and she just walks off like nothing ever happened, I&amp;#39;m devastated but I know I&amp;#39;ll get better with time. I have to block her from everything so I can allow myself to heal and get over her. Besides this there are good things  happening in my life, I got a raise and a vehicle but is so hard to focus on the positive when all I think is her. I hope the best  for her but it&amp;#39;s time to let go and focus on player #1, ME.&lt;/p&gt;

,BreakUps,"My ex dumped me to “focus on law school” in June. I was a wreck for a while. This sub has really helped me and I am loads better than when it first happened.

I’ve taken a lot of steps to improve myself and become the best version of myself. I’m listening to audiobooks on motivation and philosophy. Working out regularly. Cold showers. Exploring new and old hobbies. 

All the stuff that everyone says you should be doing. And 90% of the time I feel great doing it. But that 10% I feel stuck. Maybe that’s just my brain wanting instant gratification for my tribulations. But idk.

The biggest thing contributing to this feeling is I started working for my ex’s neighbor. I started doing paid work around his house when I was with my ex because he owns a business in my field and he would be a great connection to have.

Slaving around his house is starting to pay off because he said in next couple weeks he will have me start working in the office. Which is awesome! We talked about long term career plans and everything! It really is an amazing opportunity to start to my career as a recent college grad. 

But I can’t shake this feeling that my ex is off at law school moving on with her life and I’m still stuck working at her neighbors. I guess I’ll feel better when I start going into the office and start making big boy money. 

But being there all the time and bumping into her family just sucks. It gets easier everyday and I care less and less but Idk if I’ll ever fully be over it.

,BreakUps,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. My ex (21F) and I (18F) had been dating for two and a half years as a long distance (LDR) couple. We originally met online four years ago while she was still in high school  and were close friends before we began to date. We had a pretty loving relationship but it was not without its arguments. Last year, we had a short break up that lasted one week. Since that breakup, we had been doing fine up until June during the quarantine. Our original plan was to break the distance by going to college in her home state, but after seeing it would not work out (I am low-income and got a full scholarship to attend a prestigious institution), I ended up committing to a college in another state. My ex is graduating next year so we were going to try to see if she could do her Master’s program nearby. We only were able to meet twice in secret as my mother is homophobic and did not know about our relationship. Although there were issues with us going to school in different states, we were excited at the chance to fly to see each other more and often planned our future together. 

Then comes June of 2020. A sudden family issue caused me to want to take a break as I was stressed and afraid of taking out my feelings on my ex. She ended up having to deal with her own issues with friends and family, so we mutually decided to take a break for a month. The break was made to be so that we would not take anything out on each other. Throughout the break, she would text me to check in and we would speak for a little bit. The longest NC we did during that break was two weeks which lasted until the day we decided to end the break on. The day the break ended, we chatted like normal and flirted. I asked her what our relationship status was, and she took two hours to respond to say that she was not sure and we should probably speak about it. She asked what I wanted and I said I liked the two of us together and then she said we were better off as friends. In the breakup text, she used “I think” a lot, stating “I think you were/are right, I think I have more platonic than romantic feelings for you” and “I think I communicate with people better in person.” She said she still loved me and wanted to remain friends. I was shocked, because the break was not about our relationship. But I told her I would always be there for her. I asked if there was a chance of us ever getting back together and she said ""maybe.""


We did one week of NC, and then she texted me. We spoke like normal with minor flirting. She would leave me on read after a couple of texts but then text me the next day again. She would leave me on read and text me every other day. We would flirt and she would repost fanart of our favorite couples online.  She randomly sent me her college schedule without me asking and asked if I could send mine when I received it. She would send me pictures of her and even send a good morning and good night text. 

I recently moved into college and we finally video called since the breakup. We acted like a couple. She flirted non-stop, teasing me constantly and asking if I was “jealous” about the “fans” she had that were swooning over her. We joked around and she even mentioned that she was looking into what she was getting me for Christmas. We even mentioned the stuffed animal she gave me that is our ""son"". At one point, she even took off her shirt (showing her bra) and changed into her pajamas in front of me. After that call, we had 2 days of NC as she was on a trip. I texted her today asking about her trip and she said that her thumbs hurt (she mentioned hurting her thumbs in our last call) so she could not text and was wondering if we could call so she could tell me about it. We flirted again and she even teased me about potential girls flirting with me on campus. I mentioned how I was a lesbian and she joked “Really? I thought you were straight?”

Does my ex still have feelings with me? I really love her a bunch and would be down to getting back together. However, I want to make sure that I am respecting her decision as I do not want to lose her.

The long and short of it is we met in college, had a great time for two years, met each others parents, traveled around the country, went abroad, the whole nine yards. Then came graduation day, she had a job lined up in the town where we went to college, I did not, and the town we were in did not have great entry level prospects for my major. We talked it over and I went home to my parents to find entry level work for six months to a year, then would come back to our college town come hell or high water so we could be together.

Things were fine for the beginning, I made another trip to see her, then we went together to see her parents and she came and saw my parents again, everything was peachy. Then coronavirus screwed up one of my plans to see her, and until a couple days ago we hadn't seen each other in 3 months. In the weeks before I came to see her this most recent time, I saw the writing on the wall. Her calls were less frequent, her texts were less enthusiastic, and in general it seemed like she was trying to create distance. I sorta forced my way to come see her, and just yesterday we had **the** conversation. Or rather the conversation *about* having **the** conversation.

She cares about me, but the distance isn't working for her, the plan we had has apparently gone out the window. Shes crying, I'm crying, its a mess. It would be easier if we hated each other but apparently that's not how the cards fell. I thought we were gonna go all the way, I had big future plans that are now out the window.

Basically, there is now an imminent expiration date on the relationship, and we both know when it is. I'm with her through the end of the week, and there's some weird pseudo-relationship we have going on? Like neither of us are mad, but sort of just going through the motions like how we used to, but it all feels so hollow.

Come the end of this week, basically all of my emotional effort for the last three years will have been for naught. I'm going to have to do a long drive alone as an emotional wreck, and I can't even turn to my best friend and shoulder to cry on because she's the reason for it.

I just feel lost and sick and my body hurts and my head hurts and the future looks bleak. I can't stop going over in my head how if I had just swallowed my pride and taken a basic job unrelated to my major in our college town and went from, we wouldn't be in this situation.

,BreakUps,"The trip back home to clear out my apartment was heavy on me and seeing all her stuff has honestly taken me back in the healing process.

I'm trusting the process and sticking to the no contact rule no matter what. It's officially been a month and some days now since starting no contact and she comes to mind constantly still. The harder I try not to think about her, the more she creeps into my mind.  I have to let it go but I can't seem to figure out how to forget. Will I ever forget her? Will the pain of how things ended ever settle? No closure break ups suck and I honestly just miss her face and her voice and our routine. 

I can't even watch the new batman trailer because its got Kurt Cobain playing in the background. The memory of her has made life hard for me to live.

Maybe a lot of people will think I’m dumb, selfish and jealous which could be true I don’t really know. I broke up with her because of how she looked and talked about other guys. The first 4-5 months she would constantly talk about other attractive guys, celebrities or not. 

In one instance, she called a non celebrity a DILF. Another she saw a celebrity on TV and said “oh my god that’s my shit” right in front of me. I drove 3 hours to see her in her hometown city during a winter break from our college and she has a massive crush on a singer and the first thing she said was “his album just came out and his face is on all the billboards I lovee it”. Everytime we watched a movie or tv show there was a comment. I even tried to get her to watch my favorite TV show and within 10 minutes she pointed out 3 actors that were “sooo hot”. 

She occasionally would talk about other dudes at our college too. She would like pictures of shirtless male models in Instagram. I get a few times or a few comments but they just became so constant and intense that I couldn’t handle it anymore. I asked her to stop a few times, but she only stopped talking about non celebrities until we had a really big argument about it. 

Maybe I was being too insecure. And everything else about this girl is perfect I mean she’s amazing. I have so many great memories with her. 

She would always reassure me she would never cheat on me, she only meant them as pointing out who was attractive but would never act on it etc etc. it just became too much for me though. I definitely have trust issues and probably some anxiety because I would constantly think about these comments, feel really bad about myself, and remind myself that if she had the chance to do something with someone she thought was “soo hot”, at least based on these reactions, it seems like she would. 

In essence, I just couldn’t trust her because of this. Maybe I’m being dumb, jealous and insecure. But it does bother the hell out of me not gonna lie. Anyways, she was devastated, and to be honest so am I. Im madly in love with her. But towards the end I just wasn’t happy and was always miserable reminding myself that she’d do something with someone else. And I would always spark arguments about these comments.

My ex (M22) broke up with me F(21) for the third time in 1.5 years, two months ago. The times we were dating, he would try to give me the world... which makes no sense because he did break up with me 3 times. 

The first 2-3 weeks were awful. Crying all day everyday. I would download dating apps to just get myself distracted and felt validated in a way. They didn’t help

A month in, I still felt awful. But I felt like he will come back and reach out to me again, just like the other times. I had some hope, although I wasn’t sure if it will happen. I would dream about him every night. 

A month and a half in, I would feel the same but have days where I wouldn’t care at all and felt like there may be better guys out there for me. 

Two months in, I feel bad one day and then can’t careless the next. But one thing that changed drastically is, I cannot stand guys. I’m still on the dating apps, but they all just disgust me (as harsh as it sounds). I know I should get off of them, but they do help me in a way! I make it clear I’m just looking for people to talk to, that way I don’t lead anyone on.  

I miss the cuddles and just having someone there. But I cannot picture doing that with anyone... but him. I know, it’s still early after the breakup, but I am trying to understand my feelings. 

I want him back... but I can’t take him back. He left me 3 times... although the reason for it comes from both ends. I feel bad about not having him here, but at the same I want him.

,BreakUps,"It’s been 4 weeks since breakup. A lot of pain was felt immediately in week 1 and 2 but that’s also when friends and family are most available to you. They talk to you to help you process and  try to paint a positive tone around the breakup. “It’s a good lesson and you will be a better partner down the road”, “you will be fine”, “it could be the best thing happen to you when looking back”, “it’s better to get broken up now than later if you two are not compatible”... 

And those no contact video on YouTube just made it sound like there is still hope and you somehow in control. 

Now I moved out of our shared apartment into a house’s basement by myself. I intellectually understand the pain and it’s probably good for me down the road looking back but I am in PAIN. I am so used to have someone around me for the past 4 years. I am so used to have someone who seem to know me well and I seem to know well. It seems my ex and I were more compatible together than anyone I know right now. 

When I talk to my family, whatever they say is the almost the same from 4 weeks ago and almost the same whenever there is a crisis in my life but with added stress in their tone because it’s been 4 weeks and I seem to relapse.

,BreakUps,"Its been four days since our breakup. Me(28m)and her (24f)had been dating for six months but it had been long distance. She went through some stuff and ended up moving in with a friend of hers and she ""deactivated her Facebook"" . But something had told me to check her sister's Facebook that day. Lo and behold she had blocked me for the last month but still texted me like everything was fine.

She was my first serious relationship. And i don't want the toxic traits of this relationship to affect others. I don't wanna develop trust issues i dont wanna be nonchalant 

Tbh i had to thank her sister the next day because if she wasn't so messy who would have known when she would have had the gall to tell me. Finding a new person is fine i would have been fine but what im hurt about moreso is the fact she had chosen to cheat instead of telling me about it.

No contact begins into day four  deleted number blocked social media accounts and beun working out twice a day and logging my food. Never been so focused on studying for school, im am thankful the simester just started so i have something to focus on.

My friends have been dope and supportive but i still fell that hole in my heart. I get that dopamine boost when i work out and read about cooking or playing games but i still definitely miss her. Waking up with no one to say good morning to is tough but im getting through it.

I don't think i need advice but i guess telling my story helps me feel better i dont think i did anything wrong. But nights are rough i cant help but think about her. In hindsight she was a pretty bad gf, she was dismissive and pretty nonchalant but i cant help but want her.

Also this subreddit has helped me alot because i can draw encouragement from your kind words. Hopefully i can leave this place soon with someone new to love.

,BreakUps,"One time I’m fine being on my own the next I’m feeling depressed and thinking how the hell is he capable of treating me like I’m nothing?

How is he capable of literally saying I’m not worth it and I should be blocked and not being taken care of and then say “I was always here for you” in between 

Telling me I’m dramatic and sad and depressed and that I need fixing and I’m not capable of love 

I begged him to deny the fact that he said he’s unhappy with me and he ignored me countless times countless times even when I specifically asked him to deny it he still ignored me

He leaves me hangs up on me when I cry and vomit from how anxious I am 

I stay up for more than 24 hours telling him I can’t sleep and he leaves everytime 

He sleeps he eats he enjoys life all while knowing I’m crying and crying and I want it to stop I tell him I want it to stop and he still ignores me hangs up on me and says he’s busy 

When I know he’s playing ps4 when I know he’s in the living room with his friend eating breakfast playing video games laughing and me begging him to stay online me begging him to be there and all I’ll get is “im sorry” “you’re weird” “I don’t want this you pushed me for the last time” when I have no control of my anxiety I have no control of my panic attacks I have no control of these thoughts and I’m just crying and crying 

And him constantly telling me he’s busy constantly telling me he doesn’t want me constantly hanging on me then say I was always here for you 

No matter what I say or how many paragraphs I’ve wrote he ignored and leaves because he doesn’t want to deal with it 

I beg him to reply I beg and beg and beg for everything 

For a phone call for time for someone to care 

“I’m not supposed to show you or prove to you why I want this or love you constantly”

Who says that? Why would you say that if all you’ve shown me in arguments or difficult situations how unwanted and worthless I am 

Leaving for hours and hours and not picking up the phone when I need it

I don’t think I should ask for a phone call instead of a “I don’t want this” messages 

To calm down to make me feel they are THERE not just say “I’m here” and then constantly being ignored and called weird because you’re crying and you’re out of control 

I don’t swear I stopped swearing but I swore and swore and swore because I was so hurt and even my swearing made no sense at all 

I can tell that he knows I’m in a panic state I can tell that he knows I’m crying but in his mind I’m acting or being dramatic that I’m not crying that I haven’t stayed in my room
Locked up waiting for him to message me or call me or care about me that I couldn’t sleep or eat or move because I was so anxious in an extremely unhealthy way and he knew about it 
And still left and said I was there for you

Is he a narcissist or a psychopath? To tell me he’s busy while I’m crying my eyes out and he’s playing video games while I feel like my heart is being ripped a part and he’s playing video games 

I can’t sleep or think straight or have an appetite if I knew someone was remotely hurt by something I said or did 

I can imagine his face laughing with his friends having fun being able to eat I can see it I know how it is I can imagine him laughing and having the biggest smile on his face while holding the phone looking down on my messages and ignoring me while I tell him I don’t fucking feel good 

I can see him looking at my messages and sighing and rolling his eyes and throwing his phone away and continuing talking to his friends or going on with his day or playing video games while I’m word for word laying on the floor feeling like I’m about to die 

While I message him nonstop waiting for him to come online and I keep messaging and messaging non stop for hours and hours because my anxiety kicks in and I feel like I’m heading straight to a panic attack and him ignoring me still knowing all of this knowing how unstable I am and still says “I was always here for you”

I lose sleep for someone that goes to bed like a baby like the king of the world not bothered his heart doesn’t ache nothing aches because in his mind “what’s the point of answering” “everything I say and do is bad” literally acting like a victim after telling me I need fixing after telling me I’m a sad depressed dramatic person in the middle of my anxiety attacks 

Getting amnesia and saying I did nothing you started all of this you did all of this 

He fucked me up and made me think and still makes me think this is what I deserve this is the treatment I deserve 

“You’re so fast to forget the things I’ve done for you” he calls on time ONE time and ignores the countless times he ignored because he thinks it’ll shut me up 

He swears up and down that he won’t do something and it takes him less than a day sometimes 5 mins to do it again 

He talks about himself only cares that he’s able to sleep and eat and function like a human being while he’s being toxic by telling me what I am and how I am and how I’m this broken unfixable unlovable thing that will never be loved because of the way I am 

He talks to me like he’s entitled to everything like he did nothing and he’s a victim telling me he’s doesn’t want me that he wants someone easy to deal with someone that won’t talk and send him paragraphs and messages or needs to talk to him through a panic attack 

We don’t talk we usually don’t talk we barely talk throughout the day and we’re both fine and he calls me needy because when I get a panic attack and ask for time or a phone call he tells me I ask for too much and that I always ask for time and that he has a life and is busy and can’t deal with me 

I can’t stop crying that him in his right mind right now thinks the stuff he said and did was okay when it breaks someone so much they feel like it’s better if they were to die 

I begged and begged and begged 

I begged and fucking begged for a 10 min call for two straight days 

I begged for him to be online and talk to me I begged and begged and begged and begged 

He promised and promised and promised and fucking promised and yet it’s hard to get a “can we call, I have time for you, I’ll be there for you let’s call” 

I begged him to ask me how my day was once in awhile can you imagine that? I always begged him to do the simplest thing and he says I’m not normal 

That “me and you show passion in different ways” to support “I don’t need to prove to you or tell you or assure you how and why I want this or love you constantly” when he has never done that not once 

I don’t want to go back I don’t want to go back to someone like that ever in my life I cannot. I’m scared that I’ll go back I’m scared that I will fall for his lies about caring more calling more being there for me more I’m scared I cave in and tell him we’ll give it another shot I’m so fucking scared of being with him I’m scared 

I ended things and I’m scared I beg him back because if I do he’s gonna act entitled he’s going to love it he’s going to make it worse and make me beg more and he’ll treat me more like shit because I begged him and to him it means he did nothing wrong 

One moment I’m fine the next the thought of him saying please or telling me to come back breaks my heart and makes me go back to him just to be treated even shitter and worse 

I’m so so scared of caving in I’m scared of being with him I’m so scared of him i don’t like him I don’t like this side of him I don’t like these parts I actually hate those parts of him I think I hate him I don’t think I love him at all I’ve been saying so many times how I won’t go back how I fell out of love but then I go back and I lie to myself that he won’t do this again and he will fight for me or just do something as simple as call 

I hate myself for doing this over abd over again I can’t stop crying writing these posts I have never stopped crying because of him 

I’m tired and exhausted 

I want to be able to eat breakfast and talk to my friends like a normal person or go on with my day like a normal person I want to be able to sleep and be happy and not constantly scared and anxious or someone that doesn’t treat me right would leave I’m tired I’m tired I’m tired I hate this so much I hate it I hate it I’m tired I need help I need help idk what to do idk how to say no I don’t want him to be in my life ever when he is how he is rn

&lt;p&gt;Is he a narcissist or a psychopath? To tell me he’s busy while I’m crying my eyes out and he’s playing video games while I feel like my heart is being ripped a part and he’s playing video games &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t sleep or think straight or have an appetite if I knew someone was remotely hurt by something I said or did &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can imagine his face laughing with his friends having fun being able to eat I can see it I know how it is I can imagine him laughing and having the biggest smile on his face while holding the phone looking down on my messages and ignoring me while I tell him I don’t fucking feel good &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can see him looking at my messages and sighing and rolling his eyes and throwing his phone away and continuing talking to his friends or going on with his day or playing video games while I’m word for word laying on the floor feeling like I’m about to die &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I message him nonstop waiting for him to come online and I keep messaging and messaging non stop for hours and hours because my anxiety kicks in and I feel like I’m heading straight to a panic attack and him ignoring me still knowing all of this knowing how unstable I am and still says “I was always here for you”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lose sleep for someone that goes to bed like a baby like the king of the world not bothered his heart doesn’t ache nothing aches because in his mind “what’s the point of answering” “everything I say and do is bad” literally acting like a victim after telling me I need fixing after telling me I’m a sad depressed dramatic person in the middle of my anxiety attacks &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting amnesia and saying I did nothing you started all of this you did all of this &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He fucked me up and made me think and still makes me think this is what I deserve this is the treatment I deserve &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You’re so fast to forget the things I’ve done for you” he calls on time ONE time and ignores the countless times he ignored because he thinks it’ll shut me up &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He swears up and down that he won’t do something and it takes him less than a day sometimes 5 mins to do it again &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He talks about himself only cares that he’s able to sleep and eat and function like a human being while he’s being toxic by telling me what I am and how I am and how I’m this broken unfixable unlovable thing that will never be loved because of the way I am &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He talks to me like he’s entitled to everything like he did nothing and he’s a victim telling me he’s doesn’t want me that he wants someone easy to deal with someone that won’t talk and send him paragraphs and messages or needs to talk to him through a panic attack &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t talk we usually don’t talk we barely talk throughout the day and we’re both fine and he calls me needy because when I get a panic attack and ask for time or a phone call he tells me I ask for too much and that I always ask for time and that he has a life and is busy and can’t deal with me &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t stop crying that him in his right mind right now thinks the stuff he said and did was okay when it breaks someone so much they feel like it’s better if they were to die &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I begged and begged and begged &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I begged and fucking begged for a 10 min call for two straight days &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I begged for him to be online and talk to me I begged and begged and begged and begged &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He promised and promised and promised and fucking promised and yet it’s hard to get a “can we call, I have time for you, I’ll be there for you let’s call” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I begged him to ask me how my day was once in awhile can you imagine that? I always begged him to do the simplest thing and he says I’m not normal &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That “me and you show passion in different ways” to support “I don’t need to prove to you or tell you or assure you how and why I want this or love you constantly” when he has never done that not once &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to go back I don’t want to go back to someone like that ever in my life I cannot. I’m scared that I’ll go back I’m scared that I will fall for his lies about caring more calling more being there for me more I’m scared I cave in and tell him we’ll give it another shot I’m so fucking scared of being with him I’m scared &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended things and I’m scared I beg him back because if I do he’s gonna act entitled he’s going to love it he’s going to make it worse and make me beg more and he’ll treat me more like shit because I begged him and to him it means he did nothing wrong &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One moment I’m fine the next the thought of him saying please or telling me to come back breaks my heart and makes me go back to him just to be treated even shitter and worse &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m so so scared of caving in I’m scared of being with him I’m so scared of him i don’t like him I don’t like this side of him I don’t like these parts I actually hate those parts of him I think I hate him I don’t think I love him at all I’ve been saying so many times how I won’t go back how I fell out of love but then I go back and I lie to myself that he won’t do this again and he will fight for me or just do something as simple as call &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate myself for doing this over abd over again I can’t stop crying writing these posts I have never stopped crying because of him &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m tired and exhausted &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to be able to eat breakfast and talk to my friends like a normal person or go on with my day like a normal person I want to be able to sleep and be happy and not constantly scared and anxious or someone that doesn’t treat me right would leave I’m tired I’m tired I’m tired I hate this so much I hate it I hate it I’m tired I need help I need help idk what to do idk how to say no I don’t want him to be in my life ever when he is how he is rn &lt;/p&gt;

I lost my self, my will to live, my everything. But the thought of my kids kept me going and i looked for help. Andidepressants , exercise, self improvement. Took me 2 years but i was stable enough to start living again. I met a great girl. Funny, intelligent. We spend almost 3 years together and it was great but we both knew it was not true love, more of a fwb situation. And then a year ago a miracle happened. I met the woman that i thought never existed. Funny, smart, beautiful, instant chemistry, love at first sight for both of us. Needless to say we were floating in happiness. Bit with time small problems started to appear, that's fine, every relationship has them. Then she started being more aggressive towards me verbally, that's fine, most women do. But the end was nearing even if i was to blond to see it. The last days she started ignoring me completely, even avoiding me. I tried to cope with that but she kept pushing almost like she wanted me to finally break and get on an argument so that the whole thing will end. And she succeeded. I broke and demanded explenations. She treated me like crazy and instantly told me to break up. I was stunned, not even objected. When i realized what happened i started blaming my self for my meltdown. I reached out to her telling her it was unfair for our love to end like this. She responded that there was love and we could meet and talk about it. My heart pounded like crazy.. i responded i wanted to as soon as possible, i love her, i want to touch her, to kiss her and never let her go... And.. she didnt say anything...

,BreakUps,"Hi,

I have been dating this girl for four months started on April this year. we were working together for a year. It was an exciting relationship and we kept it secret. 
The twist is here: she lives with her ex as he couldn’t move when they broke up back in Jan and stayed longer because of COVID therefore we were always meeting at my place. I asked her about the situation between her and him twice she was secretive a little bit and I didn’t want to put pressure on her.

I had to break up as my family would not accept her and before anything getting more serious I told her that and asked her to be friends. She said she loves me and will take time to get rid off this feeling. From texting and seeing each other everyday it turned to not texting at all.

There I realised that I love her, so I started to talk to her and wanted to get her back. She noticed that as I was starting to tell her that I love her too. Yesterday wanted to see her but she said no because she was low in mood and was going to see her mom. I saw her walking after she said no and we met hugged and left her.
But then I said no I will run after her and tell her I love her, kiss her and say I will fight for you. 

While I was running she entered a bar and saw her with the ex!!!
I was fuming I entered the bar and realised that she saw me and the ex boyfriend seemed to know me as his expression showed he was scared. I didn’t do anything.

I texted her asking for questions, was she lying to me and was sleeping with both of us? Or what.

But she was answering with no and i was her only one this year. But then she blocked me and I can’t talk to her. As I don’t know why she was the one who blocked me. I should’ve done that. I told her that if it was me I would never let someone think about me bad. 

What shall I do now????

,BreakUps,"You can’t text them, you can’t like their posts, and you can’t watch their stories. I have always regularly posted stories on my socials, and I know he watches them, but he hadn’t posted anything on social media for months and months before our breakup. Just over 2 weeks into NC he started posting stories. He’s been doing it for a couple days since then. 

It’s been hard, but I’ve not watched a single one. From seeing little previews on the ‘recent stories’ tab, I know he’s posting images of himself going out and seemingly having a good time. He is not. They are not. Especially if they’re not someone who normally posts on socials, it is extremely likely they are now posting these pictures of them going out and drinking/ eating/ shopping to overcompensate, possibly get a reaction out of you or see if you’re viewing their story to see if you still care. Do not do it. They need to really think that you’re stronger than they anticipated and that they might really lose you. 

I know for a lot of people doing NC to get their ex back isn’t healthy for them, but if you’re someone who had a good relationship and truly believes that someday, you two could be an amazing couple, you need to stick to NC as much as bloody possible. Your main goal is to improve yourself and heal, but also doing it to improve your chances of your ex coming back isn’t a bad thing (as long as you make yourself top priority). Just know it’s not guaranteed. 

If they do come back, it’ll be because you did what you were supposed to do and hopefully you two can work it out. If they don’t come back, then doing NC, showing them you’re above it and taking care of yourself will help you eventually move on with your life and love yourself. Either way, NC and self improvement creates a win-win situation for you.

Do not watch their stories, and do not believe for a second that they’re having the time of their lives without you. They are not. They’re bluffing and possibly trying to provoke you or soothe their ego. Show them that they possibly have really lost you. Keep on keeping on lovelies x 

PS: watch Coach Lee on NC and on how to deal with breakups, that dude has helped me a lot lately. Just remember that you’re not doing NC just to get your ex back - you’re doing NC for you, and if your ex comes back and you two work it out, then that’s a nice little bonus. Otherwise, you’ll be able to thrive without them eventually. And even if they do come back, you may realise you don’t care anymore!

Especially if they’re not someone who normally posts on socials, it is extremely likely they are now posting these pictures of them going out and drinking/ eating/ shopping to overcompensate, possibly get a reaction out of you or see if you’re viewing their story to see if you still care. Do not do it. They need to really think that you’re stronger than they anticipated and that they might really lose you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know for a lot of people doing NC to get their ex back isn’t healthy for them, but if you’re someone who had a good relationship and truly believes that someday, you two could be an amazing couple, you need to stick to NC as much as bloody possible. Your main goal is to improve yourself and heal, but also doing it to improve your chances of your ex coming back isn’t a bad thing (as long as you make yourself top priority). Just know it’s not guaranteed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they do come back, it’ll be because you did what you were supposed to do and hopefully you two can work it out. If they don’t come back, then doing NC, showing them you’re above it and taking care of yourself will help you eventually move on with your life and love yourself. Either way, NC and self improvement creates a win-win situation for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not watch their stories, and do not believe for a second that they’re having the time of their lives without you. They are not. They’re bluffing and possibly trying to provoke you or soothe their ego. Show them that they possibly have really lost you. Keep on keeping on lovelies x &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: watch Coach Lee on NC and on how to deal with breakups, that dude has helped me a lot lately. Just remember that you’re not doing NC just to get your ex back - you’re doing NC for you, and if your ex comes back and you two work it out, then that’s a nice little bonus. Otherwise, you’ll be able to thrive without them eventually. And even if they do come back, you may realise you don’t care anymore! No matter what, you’ll be alright.&lt;/p&gt;

I know hope is dangerous, but should I have my hopes up of one day getting back together? I love him so much, and it's just very difficult right now.

I apologize for the word wall coming up ahead

I just got out of my first ever relationship. I've never dated before, partly personal choice party circumstances, but let's just say I'm never the 'pretty' friend, strictly average. He was married previously, but his ex-wife cheated on him, they separated a little after their 1 year anniversary, and officially divorced a couple months later. We met at work, out of pure circumstance, got talking, and started dating (this would be a couple months after the official divorce). His therapist mentioned waiting a year, but when telling her that we're dating, she said it sounded like a great relationship.

And it was. He was patient, kind, attentive, understandable, everything I could've asked for. I tried to be the same, although of course I had no idea what I was doing. I fell in love, of course, but he didn't, at least I didn't know it at the time. We had several hard conversations, and he would always end with ""I don't know"" when I asked if he could ever love me.

The past few weeks/months we've been talking about maybe moving in together, it's just logical. He said yes at first, but then seemed hesitant, so I asked him outright if he still wanted to do it, and he said he wasn't sure. I brought it up again a few days later, and he said he would talk to his best friend and sister to try to sort out his feelings. About a week goes by, he says he wants to move in, and finally tells me he loves me. After more than a year since we started dating. I was over the moon, I was so happy, he finally said it. It finally felt like we were moving forward again.

The next few weeks we started looking at houses, trying to schedule appointments, everything was perfect. I stayed over at his house, he stays over at mine, everything was normal. We were just at his parents' house, visited with his brother, made plans for the future. Then out of the blue last week, he asks if he can come over. I say yes, of course, we haven't spent a weekend together in a month. He walks in, red eyes, teary, and I knew something was wrong.

""I love you, but I'm not in love with you"". I felt like my world just crumbled before my eyes. All the plans, all the hope, everything. It hurts. It hurts so bad. I love him so, so much. He said he's been trying to get himself to feel like he should, but he just can't.

We decided to give each other space to heal, and after, to remain friends. He's become one of my best friends after all of this, and I his, and I want to keep him in my life. We were friends before, and although it hurts now, everyone keeps saying that it'll heal. I'm not angry, not at him, I don't think I ever could be.

I told him, after therapy, if he wants to try again, I'll be here. But I also know that I may not be the person he chooses again. And that's okay, at least that's what I say in my head, my heart is still learning. I just feel like he has to resolve whatever unresolved feelings he has from his previous relationship first, and we might have a chance. But I also know that it might not be me again. These conflicting thoughts are torture.

I have therapy too, next week, I figured having a professional unbiased opinion could help me move forward. Looking around my apartment where his things used to be is still difficult, waking up alone, being alone. I have to stop myself from messaging him like we used to all day, everyday, because I know we both need space. I have to stop myself from wondering what he's doing, whether he's eaten, if he's going for walks, how he's doing. I **know** we both need space. It's just so hard right now.

,BreakUps," 

This pandemic understandably has been rough for everyone. Being inside was hard, seeing my family sick was rough, and dealing with it alone was backbreaking. The beginning was hard. That’s when in March I took a chance, I downloaded Tinder. I had never had any inclination to download it before but the loneliness compelled me. I swiped for a couple days, just swiping into the void. 

Then I found you. We matched and I sent over a random comment of a picture. I was surprised you responded, we exchanged numbers and so it began. At first the feeling out period was strange. It’s a pandemic and we’re all home, what is there to talk about? I was surprised we were able to carry on a conversation. Eventually we learn more about each other and I find myself so attracted to someone i’ve never met. I’m honest, I don’t like beating around the bush and you say you feel the same way! I was ecstatic, but we couldn’t go out because like I said it’s a pandemic! But I need to see you, so we have a zoom date (21st century dating) I was nervous as hell but when we start talking it goes so smoothly, I suppose all those weeks texting helped. The first time I saw you I was blown away, you were even more beautiful in person, and your laugh killed me. We keep having zoom dates and they are the highlight of my day, week, month. I ask for patience from you, I can't and won't risk my family for someone and you agree. 

Fast forward to June, we've been talking every day since March. You are as much a staple of my day as Breakfast. It comes to be too much we get tested and when we both come out Negative we have our first date. I had mentioned to you that I was shorter than you (5'6 to your 5'10) and you said you were okay with that. Butterflies are in my stomach, this is the first time we're going to meet, what if you actually don't like me once we meet? You spot me first and greet me with such a big hello and I can sense you smiling under the mask. It's awkward the first couple of minutes but once continue talking that goes right out the window. We walk by the pier, and sit under the huge Pepsi sign. We sit down and talk and it feels like I could spend forever with you. We have our first kiss and I'm over the moon. We spend the whole day together and as I'm going home at night I question.. How did I get so lucky? 

We continue meeting up for dates, maybe once or twice or even three times a week. You tell your parents about me, I do the same. I'm so happy. Every day I wake up with you I memorize more of your face, every freckle. That Pepsi sign becomes intertwined with you. It's intense and it feels right. You mention you have issues with anxiety and I say I can relate as I've been struggling with it for the better part of my life. I tell you I'm here for you because I understand mental health issues can be hard to handle alone. You smile and thank me.

It's August now. 

We have a plan for you to sleep over. We plan it for weeks. We make sure to get tested beforehand and I was so excited because I felt bad sleeping at your house so much. Everything is going great but halfway through the night, you start crying, you say you can't be there anymore, you leave and I'm left confused. I wanted to help, I didn't want you to go through it alone. I know how hard it can be. You need Saturday for yourself. We don't talk. For the first time in 6 months, we go a day without talking. 

I feel a pit in my stomach. 

You come back Sunday, you cry and tell me you don't deserve me, I say we can work this out together. You say you don't want to drag me down, it's not fair, it's not what I deserve. I tell you, i'll decide what I deserve. We talk about it some more, eventually I reiterate, I want you and we will make this work. You smile ruefully and we cuddle on the couch and watch Lovecraft Country. 

It's Wednesday. 

Things have been off since Friday. We don't talk much Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. Just here and there.  Monday You send me a video of you biking by the waterfront with a friend. I ask to see you Tuesday, you don't respond the whole day. I get upset, communication is big with me. You apologize but it feels dismissive.  I ask that we have a relationship check in on Wednesday. You agree. I feel the pit in my stomach the whole day.

I boot up my Laptop. The same one we've spent hours upon hours on Zoom, on FaceTime. I see your face. I know what's going to happen. My heart drops as I say hello, I missed you. We talk and eventually you reiterate what you said Sunday. You're not in a good place, and you feel like you're faking it. Every time I showed affection you felt you had to reciprocate but it didn't feel right. You say ""If I can't make it work with someone like you, I have to reevaluate who I am and what i'm going through"".

I can't let go. I bargain. I say We can make this work, you don't have to go through this alone. You can't tell me the same. We stay on FaceTime and cry as neither of us wants to end the call. I tell you I don't want this to be a clean cut. I want to keep you in my life. You tell me it may be selfish, but I do too. I can't bring myself to hang up. I cry and laughingly say ""it's funny in a sad way, this is how we started and this is how end"". After 30 minutes of talking.. we hang up. 

It's Thursday

I am stuck in this in-between place. I don't know if i'm okay or not. I sent one last text to tell you one more time. I want this to work. You say, I have to stand by my decision, I'm sorry. 

I'm sad yes but i'm also thankful. Thank you for being with me through what may have been the hardest period in my life. For brightening my day with your smile and illuminating my day with your texts. Talking to you kept me going and being with you filled my heart. I loved every moment of it and would do it again in a heartbeat even knowing the outcome. I told you you deserve the world and I tried giving it to you. I wasn't lying. You do.

I miss you. I really do miss you, but i can't allow myself to do so. Not after what you've done. You barged right in through the front door of my heart when i most needed it, but left in the same way. You left a mess behind you, you left a mess of me, i'm a mess now, that's all that's left of me.
Now, everyday i wake up, i hope you're gonna come back and clean the mess you've made. I long for you in my arms again, taking away the pain and the mess i am inside. 

So, that's it. I fucking miss you. God knows how much i wanted you to be here. I hate myself for it, but it's the truth.
I miss you like hell... but i can't. I can't allow myself to miss you.

Anywhere you might be now, in whosever's arms you may be, whatever bed you might be laying down, i hope you're well and happy. Because i aint able to hate you, even after what you left of me behind.

I'll keep walking down my road, just like i was before you came along: alone. And just like then, i'll keep healing the ache it is to love someone. Loving is hard, and people like you makes it even harder. Although all of this, i won't give up on it and i want you to know that i'm gonna move on eventually, i'm gonna move on from you, because that's what love makes us do: move on and keep fighting till we find the one.

,BreakUps,"Just want to preface this by saying i'm pretty new to this subreddit. I didn't even know it existed before today. I've scrolled through quite a bit, and read some of the posts. You're not the only one going through this.

&amp;#x200B;

Back at the end of May, my now ex-girlfriend broke up with me. She stated that it was because she needed ""time for herself"", and that she couldn't handle a relationship at the time because of the intense psychological trauma she was going through because of idk. At the time it was understandable, I was really considerate and understanding of the whole situation. She reassured me countless times that this was only temporary and that we would be getting back together because I was the ""love of her life"" that she wanted to marry. We had been together for 3.5 years at this point.

I shared everything with this girl. Boundaries? Fuck no. We didn't understand the definition of what a boundary was. We graduated college together. She was best friends with my family. We went on family vacations together. Music festivals. Some of the greatest experiences in my life were with her. I went with her over the holidays to her hometown and spent time with her &amp; her mom for 3 years. The list goes on. And, at the time, I seriously thought she was the love of my life. The feelings I had for her completely transcended anything I had ever felt for anyone else in my entire life. I thought she was it for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

June comes around. We're still talking, pretty much everyday, but not all day like we were used to. Something to keep in mind, after we broke up SHE proposed that she block me on all social media to keep her from creeping and seeing me interact with other girls. Keep that in mind. Throughout the entire month of June, I'm still under the premise that there's still a chance, there's still hope. Being the type of person I am, though, I creeped on her socials (if you don't sign in and they arent private you can still view their profile) and this is where it all started. Constant tweets of her flirting with one of MY friends, someone that I introduced her to. We'll call him John. I kept telling myself that it wasn't what it was, w/e, but now I realize I was so far in denial. July comes. She's texting me a couple of times a week, still, telling me how much she misses me, that in a few months she wants to have dinner, you can think about the types of thoughts this puts into my head. There was one night though, at the end of the month, where I went to go look at her insta and I see comment after comment, ""obsessed with you"", ""who gave you permission to be so sexy"", you get the picture. Devastated. Self-worth is gone. I call her up and she finally admits to me that they like eachother, but can't be together because he's from another country, w/e. So, really, she had been manipulating me and lying to me. All because she wanted someone else. Over the next couple of days/weeks, though, I finally feel at peace, weirdly. After months of constant, seemingly never-ending emotional turmoil, I'm somewhat at peace.

&amp;#x200B;

For whoever needs to see this out there, you're not alone. My reason for typing this fucking novel  is to explain that everything happens for a reason. It still hurts a little, not gonna lie, &amp; there's definitely still harsh feelings of hatred and resentment, but everything in life has a natural order. Trust the universe \[or whatever you believe\] that everything will work out like it's supposed to. She's not the only girl or guy out there, I promise.

&amp;#x200B;

I know how you're feeling though. You're probably on this subreddit because you're experiencing something similar, one of which that cracks you to your literal core; one that forces you into deep, deep introspection inside yourself and question the very fabric of your own existence. One that makes you question who you truly are without that person in your life. That was my life, for 3 months. I felt numb. I felt like I wanted to die. I thought I could never recover from something of this magnitude. Each day that passes, it gets a little bit better. Pain is one of the greatest teachers out there.

&amp;#x200B;

If you've stuck with me this long, please just know something: it gets better. If they don't give you their time, ***they are not fucking worth it. You are the main character in your life. You will find someone, one day, when you're not expecting it, that will completely blow you out of the water.***

,BreakUps,"One of the hardest things about this is for 4 years we deeply loved each other. We spent so much time together. Shared laughs, fun times, stressful times and tears. We argued, we got through it, we turned the frowns into smiles and love again. We felt it when we made love. We cuddled. We struggled. We watched so many shows and movies together. Lord, the amount of inside jokes we had was unreal! We cooked so many things for each other, and some even together. It’s the little things I remember. All the goldfish and popcorn we ate together. The times we made fun of our roommates together. I loved grocery shopping with her. I don’t know why, for some reason shopping always felt annoying at the time. But looking back it’s one of my fondest memories.

One of the hardest things has been watching all of that fall apart in months... watching her go from my loving partner to someone who can’t stand the thought of me. Watching her love get replaced by hatred... and words can’t describe how that feels. She told me that now she wished she spent more time with her friends all along instead of with me.

,BreakUps," Has anyone ever felt emotionally numb after breaking up? It's been two weeks since my ex broke up with me. For the first week, my emotions were a wreck, like a huge train hit me or being stabbed in the heart by a knife a million times. He was everything to me. I've cried everyday, had about 6+ mental breakdowns, struggled to eat and sleep. I felt an intense longing for my ex, and I would wake up everyday feeling miserable, with no will to live or even having the motivation to get out of bed. I had an extremely DESPERATE feeling to feel happier, to feel WHOLE again.

Now, for the second week, I've been feeling emotionally numb. I don't feel anything at all. At times, I feel a moment of sadness and despair - I would cry a bit, but then I would go back to feeling nothing. I don't have the motivation to eat anymore, or take care of myself. I don't enjoy doing things I used to like doing anymore - Whenever I try and do them, I feel like Im suffocating, or some sort of disgust. I also have not eaten a meal for two weeks straight, (or even drink water). I've been eating like a piece of bread everyday, just to get through the day - I just don't want to, I don't have the motivation to take care of myself or even do anything.

I also spoke with my ex yesterday (about something urgent and important) in a call. When I initially called him, I was feeling numb still. But when our conversation started turning into a casual topic, I felt happy and I enjoyed it... But when I realized that I started feeling happy again, the train of reality hit me: ""You're not together with him anymore."" I broke down crying in the call, and had to leave the call. I felt the despair again. But only for like 20 seconds. After that, I felt nothing again.

,BreakUps,"Update after my last post

For the past month and a half it was mental torture for me I couldn't eat I was afraid to sleep (and generally not sleeping for days) and crying every night
It was me begging for another chance to a ex that cheated on me, it was me constantly asking for the truth in everything knowing for a fact it would crush me anyway 

But now? I've saw her for the vile manipulative sadistic woman she really was to me, I've saw how quickly she turned on me after 6 years and a child

How quickly she moved on with the new ""Mr perfect"" and just up and left me when I was contemplating suicide (one very bad day, got the help I needed the same day after calling) and I'm genuinely done with her... I cant do NC as we're now Co parents but I've basically cut her out my life as much as I can 

If you would of asked me 3 weeks ago would I take her back I would of told you ""in a heartbeat"" but now if she came begging back I'm genuinely just gonna put two fingers up to her blow my tongue and tell her to jog on 😂😂😂

,BreakUps,"Ever since he lost his family member He has been withdrawn, he doesn’t really respond to me, stopped video calling me at all, and I did my best to be understanding because he really was struggling and I didn’t want to make it worse.

The lack of affection or responses messed with me and I grew sad as I wasn’t getting what I felt I needed from him. I snapped myself out of this and tried to keep myself happy reading old messages from when he was capable of loving me. Despite Him never responding to me I messaged him every night and morning making sure he knew I still loved and cared for him. Then comes Monday night.

I sent a very sweet message Monday morning and nothing. At this point I was the one reminding myself about how he still cared. So I asked him later that night how he felt about me. His response was that he still cared,he is still struggling but he didn’t think the whole long distance thing would work. I asked if this was him calling it quits, he wasn’t direct but his response indicated that he couldn’t do it anymore. After him trying to justify his feelings of breaking it off I decided I couldn’t hear it and excused myself, he said he was sorry.

,BreakUps,"I met this girl over two years ago. She didn’t know it at the time, but as soon as I set my eyes on her. I just knew I had to be with her. We went out for some ice cream and hung out once, but she ghosted me. I thought it was whatever, bc we were young and relationships like that came and went. A few months later, I ran into her again at a birthday party for a mutual friend. And we kicked it off. I began to hangout with her more and more, spending the summer of 2018 together. We began to date, but broke it off because she didn’t want a committed relationship. Then after a month in the friendzone, she fell in love with me. We began dating again, ultimately losing our virginities to eachother on my 17th birthday. Months would go by as we hungout at eachothers houses, watching movies, shows, and cuddling. On a side note, we were also like fucking almost all the time haha. Anyways, we split for a little after the new year, but got back together within a month. We didn’t have any rough patches for a while, and Prom happened. We had a lot of fun. Sure, there were some minors problems that arrose, but nothing too big. As the summer began, we went to Mexico together with my family and it was the most fun we ever had. On our one year anniversary, I took her up to the mountains where we’d paint the sunset. Spent my 18th birthday with me. And broke it off again as the senior year began. All these times broken up, was because of her. I fought to get her back again. And it worked, but it just felt like a dragged out break up. Because in November, I was getting tired of her behavior and broke up with her. We spent a month away from one another before we began to talk again. and by Christmas, we were basically back together. It was clear that we both still have feelings for eachother, and we made it past the quarantine. No problems arrised from January to August. Throughout the whole summer, we were worried about Judgement day, aka the day she left for College. She left for Syracuse and I was still at home in Eastern PA. We were always talking about how we’d try so hard to communicate and trust eachother. When she left, the first few days were well, we spoke everyday, then the first weekend came. She ghosted me for the first friday, then the saturday went to a party when I asked if we could talk later that night. Sunday, she didnt talk to me all day, until at night where she tried to break up with me. I begged, I probably shouldnt have begged, but I still none the less. She said she’d sleep on it, and fully ended it the next day. I used the pretext of wanting my stuff back to go up to Syracuse to talk to her because she wouldnt give me more than 10 minutes. So the next day, I drove 180 miles to Syracuse to talk to her for an hour. Her roommate tried to get her to just leave my stuff on the side walk and not speak to me, but we spoke for an hour. I basically found out that she feels like i’m holding her back and that she loves me but can’t be in love with me. I try to be positive about everything and tried to end it with love and forgiveness and not bitter resentment. I kissed her one last time good bye and journeyed off back home. The first hour of the drive back was nothing but extreme screaming and crying, then crying, screaming, and singing to music we’d listen to at the same time.

Well, she started crushing on a guy friend, of whom she had many, and wanted to have him as a second boyfriend.

Well we have a lease together and no where else to go. She is at his place pretty often. I spent the first few weeks begging her to come back to no avail. She showed no emotion.

,BreakUps,"It's been 9 months since she broke up with me. How am I still not over her. 3 days after my birthday, night after having dinner with my family, she just left my life and I haven't been the same since. She sat me down and just told me it's over and honestly felt like it was out of the blue (we'd been together 7.5 years) - I moved for her. Apparently growing apart, different interests and wanting different things but why couldn't she have at least waited until I finished uni, even just the semester so we could've done more things together when I wasn't distracted (working full time and doing 3 subjects). I wish we could've spent that little bit longer together.

I finally removed her from my last social media account the other day. Yet no matter how hard I try, I keep thinking about her, wanting to be mad at her, wanting to be happy for her, jealous of her, missing her, wanting see her and absolutely not wanting to see her again. Whenever I'm not distracted I go back to thinking about her and all I get are dark thoughts, she doesn't care about me anymore, she's never going to talk to me again, we're never going to be friends again.  I guess nor should she. But why do I just feel continuously heart broken. Even after being with another girl, all I can think of is her. I feel worthless, unloveable, I don't even think I can have a relationship again.  My motivation to do things even work hits pretty low continuously. Family life isn't great and she used to always be there for me and now I don't have that anymore.  I don't enjoy my job but I just spent the past 4.5 years getting a degree towards it. But I don't have the energy or motivation to pursue my dream career of which I don't even think I can achieve anymore. I'm stuck now.

I continue to keep looking at her social media from an outside perspective wondering if she'll ever remove the photos of us together, a constant reminder.  I'm always wondering what she's up to and can't help it and wished I'd just stop thinking about her all together. I just wish she'd at least text me to see how I'm doing. I just want to stop feeling this pit in my stomach. I'm just feeling so lost and sore on the inside. I just honestly thought at this point, this far on, i wouldve moved on and been over her. But come on it's been 9 months.

She was one of the smartest, down to earth person. I loved how her mind worked, maybe she just wanted someone smarter than me. I loved her blue eyes, shape of body, the faces she'd make, how funny she thought she was (nah she was funny). I just don't feel like I'll find someone like her again.

Whenever I&amp;#39;m not distracted I go back to thinking about her and all I get are dark thoughts, she doesn&amp;#39;t care about me anymore, she&amp;#39;s never going to talk to me again, we&amp;#39;re never going to be friends again.  I guess nor should she. But why do I just feel continuously heart broken. Even after being with another girl, all I can think of is her. I feel worthless, unloveable, I don&amp;#39;t even think I can have a relationship again.  My motivation to do things even work hits pretty low continuously. Family life isn&amp;#39;t great and she used to always be there for me and now I don&amp;#39;t have that anymore.  I don&amp;#39;t enjoy my job but I just spent the past 4.5 years getting a degree towards it. But I don&amp;#39;t have the energy or motivation to pursue my dream career of which I don&amp;#39;t even think I can achieve anymore. I&amp;#39;m stuck now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continue to keep looking at her social media from an outside perspective wondering if she&amp;#39;ll ever remove the photos of us together, a constant reminder.  I&amp;#39;m always wondering what she&amp;#39;s up to and can&amp;#39;t help it and wished I&amp;#39;d just stop thinking about her all together. I just wish she&amp;#39;d at least text me to see how I&amp;#39;m doing. I just want to stop feeling this pit in my stomach. I&amp;#39;m just feeling so lost and sore on the inside. I just honestly thought at this point, this far on, i wouldve moved on and been over her. But come on it&amp;#39;s been 9 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was one of the smartest, down to earth person. I loved how her mind worked, maybe she just wanted someone smarter than me. I loved her blue eyes, shape of body, the faces she&amp;#39;d make, how funny she thought she was (nah she was funny). I just don&amp;#39;t feel like I&amp;#39;ll find someone like her again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long post, thanks to anyone that takes the time for my rambling.&lt;/p&gt;

,BreakUps,"Most days I'm okay, but I still get sad sometimes. I don't need them anymore but I still miss being close to them. I don't cry like I did but sometimes I still feel lonely without their company. I don't listen to my breakup playlist anymore but I still appreciate a sad song every now and again. 

I've learnt there is no quick healing switch. I don't wake up one day and just forget about them. Opposite really, I think about them a lot but instead of dwelling on what I've lost, more and more I get excited for what's coming. 

It's hard knowing they're with someone else but what's harder is accepting they're not with someone better. Better for them perhaps, but my own sense of value shouldn't come from another person's opinion of me. It's hard to be happy for them but that's okay, it's not meant to be easy - they broke my heart. 

I tried to replace them with new people but ultermately it made me miss them more. Now I'm happy just being me for a while and I have enough faith in myself that I will fall in love someone else when the time comes. 

Despite all the new things I've done I haven't won the breakup. There is no winning. I've focused on doing things for myself and not to improve their image of me. In all honesty they probably don't even care anyway. And that's okay too.

,BreakUps,"Im writing this non-anonymously in the hope she'll see how much she's missing, and how much she destroyed me. I don't even care about showing my feelings anymore, Im fucking destroyed. 

My girlfriend of four years left me on 17th of august. 

Sometime in early July, she told me she had fallen out of love for me. She didn't feel anything anymore. I reacted impulsively, as I always do, told her to leave the apartment. A few days later she came and picked up most of her stuff, I was in the apartment, crying my heart out. We ended up talking for ours about ourselves, and she ended up sleeping at the apartment. 

She hated my/our apartment, and I don't blame her, its cheap, but its ugly and dirty and small and its in a poor neighborhood and it sucks overall. I want to move out too, but we never discussed it, a common occurrence in our relationship. So during the next month, up until the 17th, we were together, but she was back at her parents and we saw each other about 5 or 6 times, every time, having beautiful ""dates"" where we shared a lot of intimacy, laughs, smiles and just overall fun. Up until she didn't text me that monday morning, after probably the best day I ever had with her on Sunday. I knew something was up, and when I texted her, she ended up telling me it had to end, that she didn't know if she could love me, that all she did was think over and over and that she felt like she was just delaying the inevitable. On that day, I told her I loved her, so, so much and I told her if she wanted to make it work, that she just had to text me.... It never came. 

Been 10 days now, started feeling better, Im seeing a psychiatrist, Ive tried activities I always wanted to try like Olympic weightlifting and jiu-jitsu. I wasn't over her, but I was feeling better, I didn't have a mental breakdown for two straight days. Yesterday she texted me about the internet bill that I needed in my name... Everything was cordial, I made a few jokes and she got angry right away (Why ? Thats not her, she's the funniest and easiest-living person on this fucking earth, why is she acting like shes not the person she was ten days ago?) and I also told her I had things she needed to pick up at the apartment, and she ended up telling me she can't come back, that she can't see our dog again, that she can't be in the apartment again. Now that got my head spinning, and Im back in a bad, bad place.

I don't even know why Im writing this, this isn't me, Im an alpha fucking male usually, Im not a chaser, I don't need anyone to be happy, I know Im good looking, I know I can do most of what I want to do.

&lt;p&gt;Ex and Y are total Narcissists and are friends with 90% of the class. They can literally influence anyone. I am really scared I won&amp;#39;t have any friends in the class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 1 - There&amp;#39;s only one batch per year. So it looks really bad when I hangout with people other than my batch.&lt;/p&gt;

,BreakUps,"This might turn into a bit of an essay, which I apologise for. There are so many things in my mind and I just can’t wrap my head around anything.

My boyfriend of almost 2 years broke up with me 2 days ago. It’s come as a complete shock to me. We’d never even really had a fight before this, so I had no idea that he was feeling the way he was feeling. Just for some context, I’m currently in university studying for a second degree, while he graduated a few years back and is currently working. When we met, I had a student house, and we tried to see each other a few times a week. I moved back to my parents this time last year (he lived with his parents in a town about over an hour away), and it became harder to see each other as often, because we were so busy. I was worried that I was holding him back, but he always reassured me he wanted to wait things out because it was worth it, and he knew I was busy with a stressful year of exams and coursework. Summer was going to be our time to see far more of each other, and he had been looking for a flat of his own for a while – then, of course, the pandemic hit. When restrictions started to lift in our area, allowing outdoor gatherings, we were able to see each other a few times. There were times he didn’t feel it was safe to see each other, and he wanted to keep respecting the lockdown restrictions, and of course I agreed and respected him for that. He recently moved into his own flat, and about this time last week, we had a disagreement about me not wanting to stay at his for an extended period of time, and I admitted I was afraid of disrupting my routine. We had a conversation afterwards, and he told me he really wanted to help me get help for the anxiety I’d been experiencing for a lot of my life, and I feel stupid for not realising this might have been his final plea to fix our relationship, and I didn’t even realise. I was scared of getting help, because of some bad experiences in the past, and I couldn’t admit it. I made a mistake, and I was embarrassed, and I was a little quieter when we were talking. I didn’t visit him during the weekend because I had just come back from a short trip away and was seeing some family, and he regularly sees some elderly relatives, and I thought I was doing right by him and his family by keeping away because of the COVID situation. He asked me to stay at his during the week, but I was a little nervous because I had some online training to complete, and I didn’t want to disrupt him working from home, even though he said he’d gladly give me the space. I was too stupid to agree.

A day or two later, I got over myself and decided to message him to ask if we were okay, because I knew I was acting like an idiot. He said he didn’t know if we were okay, he wanted to talk on the phone. We had always worked out any problems before, but I could almost tell what was coming by the way he had been acting. But it still hit me like a ton of bricks. His exact words were “maybe breaking up would be the best thing for us, or maybe it’ll be the biggest mistake of my life.” He didn’t know what to do, and phoned his mum for advice, and that’s when he decided to break up with me. He cried down the phone like I’ve never heard anyone cry before, about how I was his best friend, he still wanted me in his life, but this was for the best. He didn’t want to fix things – they were suddenly unfixable (in my eyes, at least). He’d been in denial for a while, and reached breaking point, because he was lonely and I wasn’t seeing him as much as he’d like. He mentioned some other things (sex), which we had talked about in the past at length, and he always assured me would never be a problem. Just last week, things were normal, I was the love of his life, and he was my mine, we were talking about our future, and getting married. Having kids at some point had even become a topic of conversation. Why did he not tell me when he first started having these doubts? When did he even start to have these doubts, when I thought things were going as well as they could during a pandemic? What did I do that made him feel like we were unsalvageable? I feel like a stupid little girl who has been strung along for months by a liar. Is he lying? Does he thing he’s doing the right thing, like I thought I was doing by not seeing him? I’ve tried to message him since, because I have some of his things and I want to return them. He’s a completely different person. I’ve embarrassed myself but just not understanding how this has happened. He told me over text that it’s past fixing and I just can’t believe we went from being in love to this in the space of a week. I feel so fucking stupid, like he was manipulating me without me even realising it. He's one of the nicest, sweetest people I've ever met - was he hiding behind a facade and I never knew? I thought maybe he was upset and needed a break, but after seeing him on Tinder, and then him deleting our photos off social media, and him texting me things are past fixing, after I embarrassed myself by almost begging for a reason. I know. I've fucked this up irreparably.

I feel like he broke up with me, and the reason he gave was a lie, or I don’t know. Did he really reach breaking point, or did I just walk right into giving him an excuse to leave the girl he felt too bad to dump? I feel awful for doing it, but I downloaded Tinder and started swiping through. And there he was, already on it. Not even 4 hours after he left me. I am so fucking heartbroken. Like a child, I asked if there was anyone else and he said no, but is that the truth or just another lie? How long was he on Tinder? When he was talking to me about where we’d have our dream honeymoon, what we’d name our kids, the life we would have when I finally graduated, had he already made a new profile? We met on Tinder all those years ago, he was persistent and chatty and didn’t care that I had a cold and looked like shit the first time we met, and how he’s been a constant in my life every day since. Now all I can think about is how maybe, right now, he’s doing that with another girl. I feel like a stupid, overdramatic little child. But I feel like my life is falling apart.

I know things must get better, but right now, I feel like I'm going insane. My emotions are changing every 5 minutes. I feel raw, I shake when I think of him and I don't know why - anxiety or panic, maybe? It's taken me ages to write this post. Sometimes I'm angry, sometimes I'm not. I couldn't sleep at all that first night, but last night was slightly better. I felt calmer at some points, but still didn't get much sleep, and this morning my heart still hurts. I'm not really eating, because I feel sick to my stomach. I feel like a stupid little girl, I thought I would never be this way. I've always been afraid of commitment, and had never had anything more than a kiss on a night out before. He was the one constant I had in what has been an honestly shit few years for me, and I feel like I've been tossed away like I meant nothing, and he doesn't even care.

He has never, ever acted like this before. Why didn’t he talk to me when he first started having doubts? Was he lying about loving me? Was everything a lie? When did things become unfixable, and when did he decide I wasn't even worth being told that? Were his tears after breaking up with me fake? Were they tears of relief? Did I ruin this whole fucking thing? Was I never enough for him, and he was just too cowardly to tell me? I know it’ll get better, but right now I truly fucking hate myself.

,BreakUps,"I just got reminded of it recently and I've been feeling a bit low, a part of me is over it and another part of me is hurt really badly. So I just want to get it off my chest.

It's gonna be long.

It was a 6 month relationship, so it wasn't that long per say but it felt like an eternity. Eitherways, I'm in the senior year of highschool rn..so you might be thinking..highschool rels dont last anyway so what's the big deal..but you know..my feelings are still hurt and I'm still human so the hurt is very much real. Maybe not as intense as what you adults might be going through but it still scarred me.

It was my first ever relationship..and I'm from an Asian family so I'm not really allowed to date but I did date him anyway cause I thought we were meant to be you know? He was my best friend. I thought even if things ended they would be cause of long distance once we go to college or something. But what really happened was just me getting heartbroken over an asshole.

I'll summarise the relationship for you first. Well I confessed my feelings over text to him cause he was flirting a lot and I dont really like mind games tbh, I like being straightforward. So I told him that and that I'm not allowed to date nor am I interested to date at this age and stage of school. I just didnt want distractions and I wanted him to stop flirting. I get that my method is very unconventional, but I thought if I told him my feelings then he would reject me and I can move on with my damn life. I know that seems pretty confusing cause how does confessing feelings result in peaceful single life.. well yeah, that is if he rejects me. Why did I think he would reject me? Cause I just did, there isn't any underlying reason but just the fact that I didnt think anyone would like me in that way. He didnt think too much and said he liked me back.

For a few weeks it was sort of this situationship cause we were unsure of what to do cause..I didn't really want a relationship. We didnt talk about it properly but somehow it became a relationship? Messed up, ik. But yeah, we were in a relationship. 

His behaviour in the relationship was fluctuating. In a way that one day he would be all lovey dovey and the next day he would just not talk. Like, even as friends..that seemed so hurtful, but I let that slide. Once I hung out with my guy bestfriend and I told him about it and they both even know each other alright..and he was chill w me and him hanging out. My guy bestfriend and him coincidentally met up at a party and he decides to ask my friend IF WE HAD SOMETHING GOING ON BETWEEN US. Like fuck dude, he asked my friend if I was cheating on him or some shit like.. back then I didnt think anything of it cause my bestfriend said it like it was some joke..but then when I asked about the incident to him at the time.. he denied it ever happening.

Heck, he didnt even do anything for my birthday eventhough I GAVE THIS ASSHOLE 3 GIFTS - A VIDEO MESSAGE FROM ALL HIS FRIENDS THAT I MADE, A DIARY FILLED WITH NOTES FOR HIM AND A LONG ASS MESSAGE ABOUT HOW I FELT AND CHOCOLATES FOR HIS BIRTHDAY. I'm not materialistic but...where is the fucking effort?????? Even a damn happy birthday card would do but nah. Nothing.

He never showed up for any of our dates. He made me perform two songs at a gathering only for him to not show up and hangout with his other guy friends some place else. He insulted my other guy best friend whom I've known for YEARS when all three of us met.. he was thankful and had this weird smile on his face when he got to know my guy best friend is potentially gay.

When I walked off with my guy best friend to my house I didnt say ""bye"" to him (cause he was talking with his other friends and ignoring me) he got pissed off like I was doing something wrong. Like fam, I'm in a strict Asian household. I'm needed at home. You pissed me off by insulting my friend and not even talking to me. 

Soon after that incident, we had a fight about his ex. His friends told me stuff that him and his ex did which I didnt even know of. Of course it was in his past but HE DIDNT EVEN MENTION TO ME THAT HE HAS BEEN IN A RELATIONSHIP BEFORE. I confront him, he doesnt have an answer. He stalls answering me. Gets pissed off. I APOLOGISE WHEN I DIDNT EVEN HAVE TO. I try to make things better again. He promises to not leave me and so much other shit and the day after he makes those promises, HE BREAKS UP OVER TEXT. over fucking text. Like that's all I'm worth???? Also, might I add, DURING MY 11TH FINAL EXAMS. I WAS DEVASTATED, I HAD AN EXAM THE NEXT DAY AND GOD I COULDNT EVEN OPEN MY EYES TO DO THE PHYSICS PRACTICALS.

He spread rumours about me and bitched about me. He said he would meetup with me and talk about the breakup and FAILED TO MEET ME TWICE WITHOUT ANY NOTICE. I slowly started moving on knowing that he was an asshole and that I didnt deserve ANY OF THE TREATMENT he gave me. 4 months after we broke up, he texts me saying he is sorry and wants to be friends. I declined. It's been 7-8 months now. I'm okay but it hurts knowing I fell for this dude. It hurts knowing he is out there doing alright when i was crying and i was fucking devastated. I dont know how such people even function knowing that they hurt someone deeply and severely.

I wish that meant something to you, and I wish you could have given it a chance. I'm sorry I wanted to move on with my life and grow. I'm sorry I wanted you to grow up and share my life with me. Fuck me for wanting kids and to be my own man, right?

I never promised you something and then bailed on you. When I said I would be there, I would be there. But you told me you couldn't imagine a life without me and then bailed on me. You just left me here. Alone.

I was even trying to open up with you. And I guess you took that and decided it would be too much work. That it wasn't EASY, like everything else in your life. It wasn't COMFORTABLE. And SAFE.

You asked me to be vulnerable, and then you stabbed me in the chest. And it sucks, because I blame myself for it. Everyone told me to not stay with you when you went behind my back. But I stayed. And when they told me again, after you spread lies about me, I stayed. And when you sought COMFORT in OTHER people. 

I STILL stayed. 

Maybe I shouldn't have, and it wouldn't have hurt this much.

But I'll move on. Because I am strong and I can get through anything. I will keep on fighting and striving for greatness.

 You on the other hand I'm not too sure. Where would you have been without me? How are you going to go through life, with no plan, no future? You wanted to feel safe, and instead you threw away the person who built you up the most. I was THERE for you. Through the self harming, and the purging. 

I was willing to do anything for you, and I did my best to get better, and to live through my struggles. Even when you kicked me while I was down.

But all you cared about was how you felt. And what you were doing in your life. You had no room for me, and I can see that now. You just wanted the attention, and the support, but you didn't want to give it back. You couldn't handle being the strong one. You blamed me for it every time you had to step up.

So that's it. I threw it all away. I broke the bracelet, and tossed the painting. I deleted every picture I had of us, and deleted all of my social media. I am going to focus on myself, and becoming the best man I can be. So that when I do find someone who cares for me, in everything, it will be for someone who deserves me.

And I will deserve them. Because I sure as hell didn't deserve you and the way you treated me. 

The worst part of this, is deep down some part of me still loves you. But don't worry. I'll move past that and toss that too.

We're not coming back from this, and I hate that. Because I wanted nothing more than to be with you. Forever.

But we agreed that was the final straw. No more chances, for either of us.

,BreakUps,"Okay so this is a long one, bear with me....lol
I posted the other day about on/off relationship with my ex. I'm gay and he's bi. I'm a Libra and he's a Capricorn (for anyone who believes in Astrology) We were together for 2-1/2 years. I was his first relationship and he was my first. Everything was going great and we always had a good time. He waited 2 years to have sex because I was a virgin and nervous. 
2 months ago he broke up with me for the 1st time. He said it was because I was too annoying (certain things he told me to stop doing that I didn't, like bothering him at work) and that we weren't having sex a lot. He told me he needed a girl, didn't love me anymore and that we can be friends. Then 4 days later he came back and said he loved me and wanted to make this work but that I needed to promise that I would change. 
We lasted a little over a month and then he broke up with me again. He stated the same reasons....that I didn't change, was still annoying and that I was faking wanting to have sex just so I wouldn't lose him. 
So I did the no contact rule and lasted 2 weeks. I couldn't take it anymore, so I contacted him and asked to talk. He called me and we talked and he again said we can be friends, so I said okay but also asked if he could just give me another change to prove that I've changed. 
We hung out 2 days after that call. I couldn't help myself...and started crying right when I saw him. He let out a laugh and said "" I knew you were going to do that"". He just doesn't show emotion like I do. He gave me a long hug and we sat down and I tried talking to him. We had sex, which obviously was a mistake. He then went from saying we can be friends to we can be friends with benefits in less than an hour. He then said we can hangout, but not a lot because he's very busy. Then he said again that he needs a girl, but it's impossible to find one that just wants to hookup. 
He's SUPER hard to read and I just don't know what to believe. He changed since he finally got a stable, good job. Even his best friends, whom I had a talk with, said he has changed. I honestly think he just wants to be single and fuck around, but he just doesn't say it. Like does he still love me a little bit? He is going to come back again and do the same thing he did and give me another chance? 
I literally treated him like a KING, been there for him when he was a recovering drug addict, showered him with affection, etc. Nobody else....girl or boy....will ever treat him better than I did and I know that for a fact. 
I know everyone is thinking I'm desperate, a doormat, all of that...and I'd have to agree.

My problem is everytime we talk, he ends up asking for nudes or sexts. I don’t do anything that would make turn him on or anything like that. The first time he asked we exchanged nudes etc. and I cut him off the morning after because he was rude to me afterwards. 

I maintained no contact for 9-10 days and I finally broke it because I needed something college related. Which he happily gave. In return I asked if he wants anything and he wanted nudes. Yet again. This time I refused and told him I don’t like the way you behave afterwards. 

And he seemed to get offended or whatever and cut me short and said good night. It seems like he is rude usually in the morning but at night he seems to ease up and behaves better.

So I was able to fall asleep after writing my previous last night but I woke up around 3am in a cold sweat and I was completely dehydrated. I could hardly breath or move. I was just staring at my ceiling and freaking out. I couldn't tell if I had dreamed of her because I couldn't remember but I think I did considering the way I woke up. I lied there for about 15 minutes not being able to breath and feeling like I couldn't breath. I finally gained control of my body and tried to rush to the kitchen to get some water. I was drenched in sweat and I was freezing. I gulped down 2 bottles of water and started to feel a little better. I went and lied back down with my lights on and cuddled up with a shirt she had gotten me while we were dating and cried for about 30 minutes. I ended up not going back to sleep so I'm still beyond tired and wore out. My entire body feels awful and my head won't stop hurting no matter how much medication I take. I wanna go take a shower and relax but I'm scared I'll black out and pass out in there again.

,BreakUps,"I talked to my ex yesterday about what we’re going to do with our apartment. He said he’s going to stay and that he’ll hire movers to move all my stuff since most everything there is mine. He said he’ll transfer everything to his name and help me out. 

This breakup came out of the blue. We had just moved in together. We talked about buying a house after this, marriage and having a family. Then a couple days ago he hits me with the “I just don’t want to hurt you anymore”. If you read my other post, you’ll know more of our story.

When we talked, I could tell he was crying and hurting. He said it’s killing him knowing how much he’s hurt me. I asked him what happened and he said he felt off and tied down. I asked him if he’s been wanting to break up for a while and he said no. I asked him if he fell out of love with me and he said no. What the fuck is happing then? He said I was great and that he’s sorry. He cried, I cried. I’m crying now. 

I hurt so so bad. I love him with all of my heart. I would do anything for him and he’s throwing us away. He texted me after we hung up saying how sorry he is and that if anything bad happens to him, he’ll know why. I’m guessing he’s talking about karma.

My best friend keeps telling me ""it's not 'if' but 'when'"" I'll find love, and ""girls would kill for a guy like me."" But, it just sucks when that's not my experience.

,BreakUps,"I’m not feeling well, so I’m gonna keep it relatively short.

Technically it ended since February, but I broke all contact 3 months ago.

I’ll explain a little in detail. 

There’s absolutely everything wrong with a relationship when we don’t see eye to with one another, and how we can’t work together to make things right for the both of us, or else it’d be unhealthy. In the end, I felt like all he really cared about was us simply being together when the relationship was beyond rehabilitating with our differences. It was rather toxic. On my end, due to my terrible upbringing, I can definitely say that I was too much of a misanthropist, being in an online relationship always made it easy expecting the worst out of things in the beginning of our relationship. I’ve gotten better throughout our times being together, learning to trust and truly love someone like I never have. It was the best feeling ever, I thought I finally found my other half. Considering that we were in a online relationship, we’d get into huge fights over being more distant from each other, how I never really felt like I was “with” him, then again I always felt that he made it harder for me to feel it. That’s what really fueled the fire, but also due to lack of empathy. I had/have no friends or family to bond with, I’m mentally ill and being lonely scares me. For him it was hanging out with friends, anxiety, running errands, wanting lots of time for himself, or anger over me. At first it was the distance, up until I learned to cope with it by pursuing my career. It bothered him, but I didn’t understand why considering he has also left me for long periods of time. I loved him enough to not let these emotions scold me, when it only brought more chaos in the relationship. I couldn’t take the pressure of it, so I left, but remained friends with him. 

Here’s the thing. I always sensed a narcissistic attitude in him. He was always trolling people. In arguments, we really made me feel dumb even when I’m right, the course of the conversations would always end in his favor, he never listened or tried to change for the better. It was also my fault for the way shit was. Made me feel like my emotions were getting in the way of the relationship. Never really seemed to understand my predicament. Also, a very ignorant person when observing other people. Only bothered to put much effort into spending mounts of time with me after wanting pursue my career, he even cared enough to buy me very expensive things after I told him how I felt about not doing that. (I’ll go into detail if you ask) Pessimistic attitude. Verbally abusive.

What really changed my perspective of him was this “joke” he made about black people, calling them “N” words for being “ghetto”…I didn’t want to believe he was really....like that tbh. A racist or self discriminative person. Even if he claims he isn’t racist, It speaks volumes, right? About just the kind of person he could be? The impression he gave exploited his character. 

I always felt like things wouldn’t work out, but I didn’t want to believe shit would be this dire……I hate that it ended this way... but I felt like I had to leave.

Now, I feel like I overreacted...didn’t give him enough of a chance to explain himself... didn’t close it off with how I really felt... I still love him, but I feel like I can’t do it... I don’t know how to express this without actually telling him... Just couldn’t believe this is really him... idk

,BreakUps,"I don't miss you in the way that I want to be your girlfriend anymore. I just miss being able to have a place or a person to run to. Sure, I have friends, but there comes a point where I'm a burden and there comes a point where I ruin the mood by talking about how things are at home. Things are really bad at home right now and I feel distressed. I remember when we first got together, you quickly realized things weren't okay at home. You tried your best to save me from it, but you weren't any better than them. You also treated me badly, even choked me out ""as a joke."" You would yell at me, take things out on me, call me names like ""r\*tarded"", ""stupid"", etc. Every bad mood swing you had, I'd take the fall for it and you would take everything out that you felt on me. You did the same thing my parents did, by telling me that my thoughts and feelings were false. Whenever I'd talk to you about how I felt about us or when we'd have a disagreement, you'd tell me I was in ""make believe world"" and that I ""only live in my head."" You'd tell me I was tiring to deal with. You made me believe this was what love is. I expected different from you since you weren't my parents. I always thought it was normal to have love with high highs and low lows. I know differently now and I don't want that kind of love in my life. I miss you, so much. I miss how you'd comfort me about things going on at home. I miss the comfort I had with you over 5 years. I miss that peaceful feeling of just baking cookies together, something as simple as that. 

I wish I could tell you about how my dad hit me again and run to you to have you just hold me and let me cry. I really just need to cry, be held, and have someone just tell me things will be okay. I know I can't do that because both you and my parents treat me badly. I know I can't do that because you got a new girlfriend 2 weeks after dumping me. If it wasn't for this breakup, I probably would've never recognized how badly you treated me or how badly my parents treated me. It's all been a wake up call. I've spent the past few months recognizing what it meant to be toxic, how to communicate better, trying to build my confidence up with expressing myself, etc. I'm also realizing that there are patterns of behavior I ignored with you and with my parents. I miss how safe I felt in your arms when you were also hurting me, putting me down the same way I was being put down at home, but I didn't know any better. Now I know better and I just want to be better and have better relationships in my life. I just want to run away, but why do I want to run to you? Part of me feels like you'd be proud of me for realizing so much, but I know you don't care. I won't text or call or anything. I don't want you to see me that vulnerable again. I don't want to lose myself to make you happy ever. I just wish that someone could hold me and make me feel safe. I need to leave somehow, but I can't right now. You were my escape and I miss you. I wonder how you're doing everyday and if you still have those suicidal thoughts, but you don't need me the way I need you, otherwise you'd come running back and use me as a failsafe like the last few times.

If it wasn&amp;#39;t for this breakup, I probably would&amp;#39;ve never recognized how badly you treated me or how badly my parents treated me. It&amp;#39;s all been a wake up call. I&amp;#39;ve spent the past few months recognizing what it meant to be toxic, how to communicate better, trying to build my confidence up with expressing myself, etc. I&amp;#39;m also realizing that there are patterns of behavior I ignored with you and with my parents. I miss how safe I felt in your arms when you were also hurting me, putting me down the same way I was being put down at home, but I didn&amp;#39;t know any better. Now I know better and I just want to be better and have better relationships in my life. I just want to run away, but why do I want to run to you? Part of me feels like you&amp;#39;d be proud of me for realizing so much, but I know you don&amp;#39;t care. I won&amp;#39;t text or call or anything. I don&amp;#39;t want you to see me that vulnerable again. I don&amp;#39;t want to lose myself to make you happy ever. I just wish that someone could hold me and make me feel safe. I need to leave somehow, but I can&amp;#39;t right now. You were my escape and I miss you. I wonder how you&amp;#39;re doing everyday and if you still have those suicidal thoughts, but you don&amp;#39;t need me the way I need you, otherwise you&amp;#39;d come running back and use me as a failsafe like the last few times. You&amp;#39;re happy and I feel alone, but I&amp;#39;m not as alone as I thought I&amp;#39;d be. So in a way, thank you for being the catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;

,BreakUps,"hey y’all

so it’s been almost three months since my ex left me out of the blue. and i know, you probably hear that all the time on this. out of the blue. but honestly, i do not know any other way to put it.

the reason i am typing this late at night is not only for myself, but hoping someone resonates with at least one thing i wrote. 

so as i’m here in bed lying around trying to sleep, the thought of her comes and goes. not as much as it did when the wound was fresh, but still, it’s very present throughout my day. i always get upset with myself whenever the thought of her pops up. “she left, she doesn’t want or love you”. it was a hard reality to accept at first, but it’s so freeing once you do. now, don’t get me wrong, it’s not a “HOLY MOTHER OF PEARL IM FINALL OVER IT” type of feeling, but it still has a sense of relief to it. and that is what is needed to get over your ex, letting go and accepting reality. no matter how hard it is to accept, once you do, it sets you free day by day. 

i’ve improved each week, and honestly it gives me joy every time i think about the progress i’ve made. i’ve started waking up early to workout 5-6 times a week. i’ve focused on a more healthy diet. i’ve thrown myself into my studies. i’ve also treated myself to a couple more minutes of video games here and there. in the meanwhile, each day i create the closure i needed back when the breakup first happened: she wasn’t the one for me.

it’s so hard to see that through the rose-colored lenses. i know, i really did think she was the one. but for what? why? i guess she was the first one i truly enjoyed myself with. it felt like i finally had a stable relationship. i learned about her, all the secrets and intricacies, met her family, yada yada you know the stereotypical relationship stuff. but once i told myself that she wasn’t the one, again, i felt free. it takes a lot to get to that point, but you just have to believe you will get there, because you will. 


we started dating in dec of 2019, and she broke up with me over text in january, but then got back together because the reasoning was that she had something come up in her life and she didn’t want to drag me down with it. when in reality, it wasn’t that bad at all, she just didn’t know how i’d react. i gave her a second chance but also let her know how hurtful it was to have it be done over text. mind you, we live in the same town and go to the same university, so it wasn’t an inconvenience to have an in person convo. all i asked was that if it ever came to it again, that she wouldn’t do it over text. she felt so bad and promised to do so.

fast forward to june, 3 or 4 days (i don’t remember the exact dats) after our monthly anniversary, she breaks up with me over text again with little to no reason. since covid-19 happened, we were back at our hometowns since campus closed. however, we were hanging out all the time since we were only less than 20 minutes away. i offered to come talk to her. i never once said we can fix this. i said i just wanted to talk it through, get a better understanding, and that i loved her. she said it isn’t something we could fix and it’s better this way. and that’s the last thing either of us said to each other. i didn’t respond. 

i figured if she can do that to me again, knowing full well the effect it had on me due to the first time she did it, she truly didn’t care about how i felt. and that right there hurt so bad.

however, i know that if someone can do that and willingly walk out of my life, they aren’t the one. it’s foggy at first but each day without her, the picture becomes more clear. little by little, i see that i didn’t lose anyone. she lost someone with nothing but good intentions. and that’s okay.

don’t get me wrong, i catch myself going back and forth wondering why this happens or if it’s me. but as i read on this subreddit, the only closure you need is that they don’t want you. so...why would you want them?

the main thing i wanna say is, don’t hold out hope for someone who willingly tossed theirs away. it may seem like it’s the end of the world, but that world never began because they didn’t stick around to build it with you. the chapter has been written with no mistakes, can’t go back add or take out of it. it happened. deal with it. just know, that you are wanted by not only your friends and family, but a total stranger out there...

So yesterday I started the census. I’m going door to door verifying information. 

So I woke up at 6am to prepare for my workout at 7am. Then I had work from 8am-5pm and I started the census right after at 5pm-9pm

Exhausted. 

I get home after 9pm and he says to me “come get your feet massage” in my head I was like yes that sounds lovely! This man never offers me anything and I told him I’m exhausted and I’ve been on my feet for the pass 4 hours. 

I initially don’t respond to his message because I was taking a shower. Then he asks again. So I said yes I’m on my way. 

I drive 17 mins to his house for him to open the door and say what are you doing here? You have to go home. 

I’m thinking he is just joking so I walk into his house. It smells like weed so I’m assuming he was smoking. He looked high. 

So we are talking and he says To me what are you doing here? I said I’m here to get this foot massage. He said oh, I was just joking. I didn’t think you were going to come. 

So I left his house Becus I felt like a fucking fool and I felt like he just constantly is playing games with me.

&lt;p&gt;I get home after 9pm and he says to me “come get your feet massage” in my head I was like yes that sounds lovely! This man never offers me anything and I told him I’m exhausted and I’ve been on my feet for the pass 4 hours. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I initially don’t respond to his message because I was taking a shower. Then he asks again. So I said yes I’m on my way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I drive 17 mins to his house for him to open the door and say what are you doing here? You have to go home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m thinking he is just joking so I walk into his house. It smells like weed so I’m assuming he was smoking. He looked high. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we are talking and he says To me what are you doing here? I said I’m here to get this foot massage. He said oh, I was just joking. I didn’t think you were going to come. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I left his house Becus I felt like a fucking fool and I felt like he just constantly is playing games with me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m like why the fuck would you do that.&lt;/p&gt;

""He's a good guy and we are adults, we can be friends."" ""He isn't using me. He actually likes me as a person.""

,BreakUps,"So I think I just want to share my story... for whoever's reading this. I just need to get everything out of my chest cause I'm so empty but at the same time.. so full of emotions. Anger. Sadness. Distress. Guilt... 

Here is my story. I met my ex boyfriend in Korea, he is Korean and I am French. I had to go back to my country but obviously decided to come back to Korea one year later with a plan, i wanted to study and try hard to find a job there (even though its really hard). So we did long distance. At first everything was fine.. and then few months later I started to think of the future. It was our first year anniversary and I realised we didn't have any plan for the future. We were just.. boyfriend and girlfriend. And maybe it was my mistake, to talk to him about this. I asked him about the future maybe, about our plans, together, as a couple. The only thing he answered was ""easy tiger"". 

Its pretty clean. I calmed down. I never talked to him again about the future. It clearly looked like he was not ready to think about that. I gave him space. I gave him space for work, for friends, for his own free time. I gave him so much space to enjoy his life because I didn't want to be the clingy girlfriend. So I tried my best. I met some people in the meantime but declined everyone when they asked me to hang out (even though it was only for friends), because they were guys. And he was not comfortable. 

So declined lot of people. Stayed home. Didn't have any friends. I had only him. So I was conflicted because I wanted to give him space but at the same time I needed someone. But i still didn't change. His happiness was more important than mine at the moment. So I sacrificed my social life. Fine. 

As the time passed. We called everyday. We slowly stopped playing games together. Video calling. And he slowly started to ask me random questions ""do you think you will be a good mother in the future ?""... ""what is your plan when you come back seriously?""... I answered them. But felt like it was not enough for him. 

And here we are. Few months later. Getting a call from him. Telling me that he wants to break up (he actually didn't tell me.. I had to speak for him because he couldn't do this. It's like I broke up with myself lol). That he met a girl at his office. And that he was sorry (of course). 

And now.. I have nothing. No friends. No boyfriend. My happiness is gone. My dreams are put on hold because I feel too weak to think about that now. And all i can think about is... he left for a girl who had a better plan in life than me. He probably left me because she had a job, she lived in his country, she spoke the same language, she was maybe prettier, smarter, funnier. But most importantly he probably thought... he could have a better future with her. He gave us up. Why did he even try this long distance ? Why did he pushed me to do long distance if it's to give up later ? I have a hard time understanding this. It makes me feel shitty. Makes me lose confidence. Makes me feel like... I'm worthless. I'm not a girl with whom someone can imagine a future with. I'm feeling all kind of emotions and I cannot get rid of them....

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I was spending time with someone (someone I could be attracted to) that made me remember that it’s not supposed to be that hard. There are so many people out there who appreciate and like me regardless of my “flaws.” I need not pretend with them or try to be someone different, someone better. Of course I did all that I could to improve the parts of me that weren’t ideal, but my ex couldn’t see that - and that’s no longer my problem.&lt;/p&gt;

,BreakUps,"I’m writing this out to flesh out my thoughts, but also maybe wanting input. I’m a month out of a two year relationship. I’ve cried enough to make a river. I’ve been anxious at times, nauseous, you name it. And while I’ve made some progress, I still have my down days. That being said, I think I’ve made a decision, it may be a poor one, but this is where my mind is at.

The breakup devastated me. I loved this girl (still do), and her reasoning did not make much sense. The only time it made sense was when she talked about her mental health, and needing to feel happy alone again before being with anyone. Regardless, it doesn’t matter, and I don’t think an answer will even change how I feel about being sad.

Although it’s only been a month, I’ve taken steps to start working on myself both physically and mentally. This breakup has fuelled a fire for me to grow as a person, and I’m so happy for it. 

But as I sit and reflect, I realize that we also had an awesome relationship, but that things got tough at the end. We were together for a year, and long distance for another. Long distance was great, but the summer months were meant for us to see each other. COVID ruined that. Both of us are in demanding fields that further made it harder to see each other this summer. With long distance, we also developed this comfort where not seeing each other was the norm (and that’s okay, but I think more effort needs to be made). And finally, she has a history of unresolved mental health issues and traumas that she needed to work on, and I believe in my heart that quarantine exacerbated those. A lot of things went wrong over the span of two-three months, and although we never fought, and had a pretty fantastic, and supportive relationship, I think it led to a little loss of emotion at the end as we were both just drained. It pulled us apart. 

In many ways, it’s a good thing. This breakup showed me that we both need to grow as people a little more because these life stresses highlighted the fact that we both have some maturing to do. Whether or not this happens for both is to be seen. I know I’m actively working on it. 

Here is where my decision comes into play. I’ve gone strict NC since about two weeks after the breakup. It’s terrible, but it’s allowed me to focus on myself. I’m taking the rest of this year until next summer to do my thing. I’ll always love her, but I’m continuing life without her.

Maybe to get back together, maybe not. I’m not sure, but I’d like a year apart at least to grow as people. If she finds someone else, then I’ll be happy for her, and the same for me, but I think we need time to grow. Is this a bad idea? Maybe. Am I holding on tot he hope things workout? To an extent, yes, but I’m preparing for life without her. I’m going to grow as a person, do my thing, and in a year, see where I’m at. Maybe I outgrow her, maybe she outgrows me.

,BreakUps,"Hi Everyone, I've lurked for quite some time and figure this will be my first and last post. 

&amp;#x200B;

In Feb this year my high school sweetheart and partner of 5.5 years broke up with me. It was sudden, and I was shocked but sure it was just a temporary thing and that she wasn't thinking straight. She had struggled with bisexuality for a long time, which I was super okay with but she wanted to explore on her own, outside the relationship. It came at an odd time as we had just been looking to move out, she finished uni and had a great job and I was just about to finish my degree too. She had even mentioned that she wanted me to propose when I finished uni. But I now know it's more likely to come right before the next step in terms of commitment. 

&amp;#x200B;

She told me she wanted to sleep with other women (which I already knew) (we had a threesome, but I didn't really interact with the other girl) and also other men, that she wanted to be with me in the end but wasn't ready to be tied down just yet. I said if that's the case, I will obviously start dating again. She did not like that at all, which I found so painfully hypocritical and one sided. After that conversation, I told my friends and family about the breakup as a way to commit to the whole thing. This really helped, as they all offered advice and love and I no longer felt alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

One friend, whom I owe a lot to told me I had a choice. That was, to start dating again straight away and fill the void she left. Or, cut contact with her and focus solely on myself in terms of mental health, physical health and my studies. He had recently been through a breakup, and told me the second option had offered fulfillment in his life he had never previously had, even when he was happy with his partner. Needless to say, I:

* Stopped replying to her non-stop self loathing messages.
* Reactivated my gym membership and joined a social sport team.
* Ran 3-5 times per week.
* Started surfing with a friend.
* Studied harder than ever.

&amp;#x200B;

This was a difficult change, but it quickly became habit. I kept busy enough to keep my mind off checking social media. It was so effective that I didn't check social media, especially her socials for a number of week post breakup. I just recently found out she has blocked me on everything, which is great as it removes any residual temptation to check in on her. The several times she has reached out via text to initiate conversation I have kept things short and to the point (never sent emojis or finished messages with an x like she did). This has clearly worked as she no longer messages me. It felt rude and wrong at the start, but I knew there was no way to repair the relationship and that it was actually best for her too if I didn't let things get carried away. 

&amp;#x200B;

After about 4 months, I reached out to an old friend from school. She had been overseas but returned to Australia due to COVID. I asked her out for a coffee, mainly as I was interested in hearing how her time overseas went. We hit it off, and after a few adventurous dates, we kissed. We agreed to date casually, as neither of us wanted to commit just yet and we both had jobs lined up which required moving away. She ended up getting hers, and the relationship ""ended"" on great terms. The whole thing boosted my confidence, and it was exactly what I needed to get back into the swing of things. Fair warning though: sex for the first time with someone else is nerve-racking if you're completely sober. The second time was much better lol.

&amp;#x200B;

By sticking to a regimented and controlled daily routine, I was able to achieve my best grades to date for semester 1 of this year and am in the best mental and physical condition I have been in for years. I have also moved out with my best friend and live closer to uni, the beach and our favourite bars and clubs. I have downloaded tinder since I moved in with my friend, and have had a few (largely unsuccessful) dates. I don't really mind though as I'm having loads of fun talking shit and having a laugh with girls again. I can tell you for sure, my game was terrible the first few conversations! It's so hard to talk to women when you really haven't had to for many years!

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, this was more of a rant/short novel than anything else but the overall takeaway from this post is:

* No contact is best for both of you (don't feel rude blocking or ignoring messages).
* Exercise (mental and physical) is key, and self improvement really is rewarding! Join a sport team if you can, it's great fun and so easy to expand your friendship circle!
* Don't forget to pick up old hobbies. I started surfing, you could start skating/biking/hiking. Anything that's stimulating and (preferably) gets you outdoors. 
* Don't rush into sex/relationships. Focus on being comfortable and satisfied with who you are first. I no longer have to rely on another person for anything, which means my next relationship can focus purely on the fun stuff!
* Reach out to friends and family as soon as possible. Stay with them if you can. The best way to distract yourself from pain and sadness at the start is to have fun with good mates!
* It's okay to cry. It's also okay not to cry. You can feel sadness, and also relief. NEVER feel wrong about the way you experience, process and progress through the stages of a breakup. Everyone is different, just focus on what makes you happy and fulfilled.

&lt;p&gt;However, if I’m being honest, I’m worried I’ll never find that kind of attraction/chemistry again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to meet someone who I’m compatible with, who feels like my best friend, AND who I find attractive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They don’t have to be a model or objectively the most attractive guy, but if they aren’t the most attractive guy to ME, and vice versus, I don’t want to be with them. I don’t want to settle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve experienced this level of physical connection, and I’ve experienced relationships with high compatibility, so I know that what I want is out there. But what if I’m never able to find them in one person? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can anyone give me hope? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Worried I’ll never find anyone as attractive as my ex.&lt;/p&gt;

,BreakUps,"I'm gonna try and be as brief as I can with what I want to say. It's been 5 months since I got dumped by my first ex and yet I'm still feeling the effects of it as if it were my first month in. She creeps into my thoughts when I'm awake during the day, and recently crept into my nightmares as well. We knew each other for about 5 months before we got together, I knew from the start that she was super into me, she even confessed to me first. But at the time, I was going through other heavy personal problems in my life so I didn't want to let her in yet and over burden her with my problems. 

When we were together, I gave her almost every second of my life, I felt like I had nothing else to give besides that. I'm not smart, I'm not the funniest person in the world, I'm not even the most interesting. All I had to give was my time and her ears. My self esteem was basically rock bottom before I met her due to my previous rejections, she made me feel wanted, she made me feel like I exist.

We were in the same class learning a third language, that's how I met her. When we started dating, I would take the same bus home as her. It was a massive detour from my usual route home, but I wanted to spend time with her after our lessons and make her feel safe going home. We couldn't meet on the weekends due to her strict parents, so I spent as much time with her as possible during the weekends at school. On those days where I took the bus with her, I would have easily spent over 14 hours in school, because my day started at 8am and I would only reach home at 10pm after seeing her home, I hadn't even eating dinner yet on those days and had to wake up at 6am the next day. I helped her with a school project that I wasn't even officially a part of, she didn't force me to, I decided to help on my own because she was stressed out.

One day, I sent her a really dumb joke regarding a female model I had seen, she didn't take kindly to the joke even though it was never directed at her. Something about that joke triggered her. She began to ghost me after that to settle her personal problems with me. I won't pretend that I'm a Saint who can do no wrong, I did wrong, a lot of wrong, but I owned up to it and apologised for it.  

When she ghosted me, my feelings of loneliness took over and I was too overbearing. I sent her a message on the days of her exams at the time, wishing her the best of luck, but I was ignored. I sent her messages saying that if she ever needed to talk about her problems, I would be there to hear them, I wasn't going anywhere. She ignored those too. I said things that I shouldnt have, made her worry about me when she should have been worrying about herself and her personal problems. 

When she finally replied, she acted weird and began saying things like ""I don't want to feel like I'm settling for someone"" and calling our relationship at the time nothing more than just a ""thing"". She continued ghosting me after that. When she talked to me again, it was to set up a meeting. The very next day, she dumped me. Even as I broke down and cried and asked for her to give me another chance, she could only give me a scowl and an eye roll. I apologised more time than I can count, she on the other hand, did not. She wanted to treat it as if we were never a thing in the first place.

A month after that, she removed me from her social media and then deleted it. I sent her a final message, saying that we were both being like kids play acting as adults, and had hoped that she could see that she hurt me just as much as I had hurt her. I wished her the best in everything in the future and said goodbye. I thought that that was the end of everything, that she wouldn't reply. That evening, her friend came after me, calling me ""A real piece of shit yknow that?"". Turns out she was the one spear heading my ex to dump me because of 1 mistake I had made. She ended off with a quote from my ex talking down on me and my love for video games, even though she knew that video games were my absolute passion.

My ex made me feel alive, like I had a place in this world, but she also made me wish that I had never been born in the first place by the end. I honestly don't know what to do with myself anymore. Because of her, I have given up studying that third language because I don't want the chance of running into her.

,BreakUps,"Hi, all the lovely and supportive people in this subreddit.   
It has been about 7 months since the breakup and I'm pleased to tell you all that I feel much better now. The same me, who thought that I couldn't imagine a life without them, is now doing pretty good. I got straight A's in all my courses this semester, whilst dealing with a massive heartbreak and living in great denial. That is definitely a personal achievement for me. I am working on myself, trying to correct my mistakes and faults. My friends have been of great help too. Talk to your friends if you're feeling low, they are no less than gems in our life. Not only did I lose my childhood sweetheart and the love of my life, but I also lost myself after the breakup. I am glad to share with you all that I have found myself again, and (re)created myself to be the best version of me. I am happy for the next person who would have a slice of the cake of the 'new' me, I want them to be glad to have met me. I don't know when or where I would find that person, but I know I'll get there, sooner or later. We all know that nothing great comes on soon or easy. 

As far as the title of the post is concerned, yes, tomorrow is my birthday. I know my ex won't even wish me. But, you know what, I don't even need their wishes to have a happy birthday.

,BreakUps,"I dated him for 5 years, owned a house for the last two. I felt us separating emotionally for almost a year, and we had always struggled with a few things consistently. So when he dropped the bomb 3.5 weeks ago I wasn’t really surprised. I think I also did a lot of grieving in advance, just due to my intuition and knowing that the relationship was distancing and was not as full of love anymore.

However, it still hurts, bad. And I CAN’T go NC. So I’m terrified it will hurt this bad for 10x longer than it needs to. Reasons I can’t go NC:

The house. We needed to take the last 3.5 weeks to decide if we were selling it or not, and we are. Probably gonna lose money too, which we deserve. At first I think there was some hopefulness from me but finding out that it’s being listed on Monday has just hit me with reality so so hard. We have to communicate about the sale. It’s furnished for showing so once there’s a sale we will have to communicate about all that furniture. It’s simply a process we just couldn’t do any quicker. We just had to take our time. But it means we have to be in contact.. and I know once that offer or sale goes through it will be like a million stabs in the chest again.

Second reason is because we share a friend group. We met through it, about 5 guys and 4 girls. I knew the girls prior so I know we are veryyy close and I know we will hang out without the dudes lots but. I also became quite close with a few of the dudes. And those guys have reached out expressing that they still want me in their life and will do whatever it takes to make us both comfy. As such, we basically had to “share custody” on last weeks camping trip (I went, he didn’t. We discussed it prior and he agreed due to the camping trip being planned largely by me). The same thing is going to come up with one of their bdays in September (although that friend actually suggested he might do two activities one with each of us lol). Camping was really fun, and awesome for me to get my mind off things and feel loved and supported. At the same time it was a constant reminder of him (people that are very close to him as well). I’m afraid that I’m prolonging the pain, but love these people so much that I’m hesitant to just cut out all of the dudes in the group for the sake of healing faster even though I know things will be different and I might see them in a group setting more rarely.

Idk, I’m looking for advice but I guess also to see if anyone else is in as messy, uncomfortable, embarassing, and logistically difficult situation as me. It seems like a lot of people in this forum break up after a year or two and still have their own places, go back to their own friends, and go NC to heal.

,BreakUps,"TW: sexual assault (kinda-ish)

i’m still trying to process everything that happened. we were together for 10 months, i broke up with him in early july because i wasn’t being treated right. we got back to school and he asked for another chance, i gave it to him. we had what i thought was an amazing 4 days together, opening up about everything, talking about how much we loved each other, allowing myself to be vulnerable again. and then he broke up with me because being in a relationship was too stressful. i said i understood and we agreed to go back to being good friends like we were in the past.

for a week he was my best friend, we got high and talked about life, hung out every day, continued to open up. he told me i could still tell him and come to him with anything. 

during that week i was... well i don’t want to call it assault just yet. but a guy at a party got me drunk. he kept making me drink more and more even when i said i didn’t want to. and he had sex with me. i don’t remember a lot but i do know that i never said no. i just remember wanting it to be over. he was very drunk too which is why i’m hesitant to label it anything. it still affected me though, made me feel absolutely disgusting and have a panic attack the next day and cry a lot.

remember how my ex had told me i could tell him anything? i did. i told him what happened and i cried a lot and i told him how drunk i was and how the guy pressured me to get drunker and drunker. i thought he’d understand. but i was wrong.

my ex walked out as i cried. i texted him an apology for telling him, thinking that it was probably too much stress, you know? he responded and told me i was selfish and to stop texting him. i stopped. the next day i found out he had told his friend that i fucked another guy right after we broke up. i messaged my ex and asked him how could he say that when he knew thats not the whole story and when i made him promise not to tell anybody.

last night my ex told me that i was embarrassing myself, that i needed to get over him, that i was ridiculous, i was selfish, and “i couldn’t care less about you right now”. i’ve never felt so betrayed and stabbed in the back. he’s never acted like this in all the time i’ve known him. i would say its out of character but i know that thats not entirely true. i’m just so absolutely heart broken that i spent so much time and effort and money and love on this person who ended up breaking a promise and saying such hurtful things.

&lt;p&gt;i’m still trying to process everything that happened. we were together for 10 months, i broke up with him in early july because i wasn’t being treated right. we got back to school and he asked for another chance, i gave it to him. we had what i thought was an amazing 4 days together, opening up about everything, talking about how much we loved each other, allowing myself to be vulnerable again. and then he broke up with me because being in a relationship was too stressful. i said i understood and we agreed to go back to being good friends like we were in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for a week he was my best friend, we got high and talked about life, hung out every day, continued to open up. he told me i could still tell him and come to him with anything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;during that week i was... well i don’t want to call it assault just yet. but a guy at a party got me drunk. he kept making me drink more and more even when i said i didn’t want to. and he had sex with me. i don’t remember a lot but i do know that i never said no. i just remember wanting it to be over. he was very drunk too which is why i’m hesitant to label it anything. it still affected me though, made me feel absolutely disgusting and have a panic attack the next day and cry a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

,BreakUps,"So long story: in 2017 I was in a relationship with a guy who treated me amazing and also had a 2yr old daughter. I want nothing more than a family one day and loved being with them both. A few weeks into our relationship he got a new job that was on the oil rig. At first things were going smoothly but after a few months he began distancing himself. He wouldn’t respond to my phone calls or make time for me when he was back from a hitch. He continuously told me he did not know why he was treating me this way now because he knew I didn’t deserve it. He made comments that I was “too good” for him not just because he thought I was “out of his league” but referring to me being a “good girl” in general:not trashy enough (as his last few relationships including the one with his daughter’s mother involved him being cheated on.) I tried reassuring him that I had no desire for anyone else. After a few weeks of hell He ended up telling me he didn’t want to be with me and falling off the face of the earth, posting another girl on his Instagram, got into a relationship 3 months later, and then engaged to a different girl within the next year and a half. 

I moved across the country to Alaska and moved on with my life. Out of all of my exes he is the only one I would have given another chance to because I fell so hard and love his daughter but I accepted it being over once he was engaged. 

Last April he messaged me a long and well thought out apology. He admitted he was insecure and didn’t realize what he had and now was experiencing the emotional abuse he put me through and realized how lonely it is. I accepted his apology and wished him all the best. He ended his engagement a few weeks later. After a few months I reached out and checked in. Over the next year we kept in sporadic contact. I was involved with someone else so it was purely platonic. We talked about hanging out when I visited home but it never happened. 

Then in May he messaged me and asked me to come visit and offered to pay for my ticket and gave me access to his truck to be able to drive and visit my family. He messaged me everyday with sweet things to say. He told me how much he hated being on his phone but how he wanted to talk to me so I was lucky because he usually doesn’t respond to anyone. When I got there He opened up about how selfish he had been and that being over the road was too hard for him to handle, being abused by the girl he was engaged to-proposing to her in hopes that it would get better (it got worse), he talked about how amazing my old soul is and my heart and that he wanted to try again. He talked about holding off on working on things at his house so I could give my input. He tells me he never stopped loving me. He asked me to move in with him and told me to go back and get my stuff. I asked if he wanted to do long distance until I could come back or just wait to figure it out. He stated he wanted to do long distance because he did not want to let me go again. 

While I was visiting he was sweet but super busy or had his friends over. Being busy didn’t bother me although I wanted to spend time with him. We talked about our goals and dreams. Having kids, adopting, fostering. We talked about if I couldn’t find a job right away. I told him I wouldn’t move in unless I had a job and he said I could as long as I helped around the house. I was insistent that I wouldn’t unless I had a job and it wasn’t a big deal to him.
We talked about how much he hates his phone again but it didn’t bother me since I didn’t feel ignored. 

I was wary of moving into his house because proceeding my relationship with him I got into a near abusive and extremely toxic relationship with an older guy who was very controlling about “HIS” house and my ex comforted me saying he was laid back and to just make myself at home. 

I decided if I didn’t give it another shot I would always wonder “what-if” so I went for it. I flew back to Alaska and let my jobs know that I would be leaving the state to go back to my home state. 

A few days after I returned back to Alaska- after talking to my bosses he stopped texting and wouldn’t answer my calls. I figured he had changed his mind so I told him since I felt single I would act single. I proceeded to continue dating back in Alaska. About 3 weeks after he texted to ask when I was coming back. I happened to be on a date and I completely felt sick to my stomach realizing he still wanted me and feeling like I had cheated on him. I blamed myself since I knew he hated his phone .So I booked a ticket back to my home state and went to see him during the week of the 4th of July. 
When I got there I asked why he went MIA and he basically reiterated that he hates his phone. I communicated how important it was to hear from him. 
He told me he is usually at his house so I would know where to find him. I stayed with my parents (an hr away) during this visit but I would drive up to see him. He didn’t text much so I wouldn’t really hear from him when I wasn’t at his home. 
One day he asked to talk to me and we went out to his garage.
He drank some beers and started opening up. He told me he knew he was pushing me away but he was hating himself. He had done something that was against how he was raised and he couldn’t figure out how someone like me wanted to be with someone like him. He cried and talked about needing to fix things in his life. He told me he had a lot of baggage but that I was slowly showing him how to love. 

The whole time we were talking I could see a letter from his ex and I thought she had wrote something attacking him and triggering this negative outlook he had on himself. I didn’t read the letter but reassured him I had thought about being with him and wanted to make it work no matter what.  The next day I made him a card with all of the reasons I wanted to be with him.

Before I flew back to Alaska I asked if I should take my stuff and he said I could leave it there. He talked about how his best friend was visiting less and that it was okay because he liked having his space. I asked what he would do about that when I moved in and he stated that he would just go out in his garage. I say ok and that I’ll see him in August.

So everything seems settled. I know not to expect many texts from him and to just power through until I’m back. I start applying to jobs near him- he lives out in the middle of nowhere so it’s actually 40 min to an hr drive for them but I have a specific career path and don’t mind the commute. I also do not want to return to my hometown so if things go south or he doesn’t want me to move in right away I can get an apartment without being in my hometown. 

No big surprise all of July I don’t hear from him. So when I come back to my hometown in August I still give him a few days before going to his place ( ten to be exact). I go on Monday and he tells me I can’t stay because his daughter is coming over and he isn’t ready for her to be around me and him. I understand this because she’s older now and I respect boundaries. (He told me I should have texted first. I almost blew my top because he had just spent a month ignoring my texts but I left him his birthday gift and went back to my parents.) 

I ended up texting him that I would come back on Wednesday. He didn’t reply. Later on my dad asked what he thought of his bday gift (my dad helped me build it) I told him I didn’t know because he hadn’t said anything about it. I sent him a joking video of my dad telling him he better appreciate it because it was a lot of work. My ex texted back and saying he had been waiting until Wednesday to open it but that he loves it. 

I go on Wednesday and decide the long distance isn’t an issue anymore so I wasn’t going to spend the time arguing about it. I just wanted to enjoy his company so I go over when he’s off work. I figure we have all the time in the world to talk now so Instead of being negative I just offer him a back rub. I stay the night and his mom comes over and makes us dinner. when he goes to work he doesn’t give me a kiss goodbye when he leaves— which he had done EVERY single time I was there up until that point. 
I started getting insecure and think of the letter from his ex. I worry she might have said something to make him consider working things out. So I go into his garage to find the letter.... 

instead.....

I find a letter from court. I worked in a law office so I recognize It and think maybe they were divorce papers and that he had been secretly more than just engaged, but then I see they are against a man. So I think maybe he got into a bar fight Over her. I’m thinking this is the reason he feels so bad about himself.

Bombshell - they’re court papers for a custody battle. Turns out he has a son to a woman ,who was married when they had sex, and she got pregnant. She died the end of May and since he is the biological father he is in line for custody but her parents and her husband are also both trying to get custody. I do the math and his son was conceived right before him and I were together the first time.

I immediately understand why he was so hard on himself. I know how much of An amazing father he is to his daughter and how he must feel having had someone else handling his responsibilities. 

I decide to talk to him, but of course it doesn’t go to plan. I let him know I’m sorry he felt that was something he needed to handle alone.
He completely shuts down. He goes to his best friend’s house and sleeps on the couch when he gets back. He then refuses to talk to me when he gets off work the next day( Friday) and leaves to spend the night at his best friends house that night. Saturday morning I leave him a note explaining that I cared no matter what but also my boundaries during arguments. For example, I do not believe in withholding affection as a punishment. I also apologize for invading his privacy and explain my perspective. 

I leave and then come back in a few days. He has his best friend over in the garage so I just go in the house. His best friend leaves and then his dad comes over. I wait until they’re gone and I go out. I ask for a hug and he gives me one. He tells me he told his dad about his son and it went better than he expected. He didn’t seem angry and I thought we could finally talk about everything. INSTEAD his neighbor comes over and interrupts and they end up getting super stoned. He had to be up early for work and so we just went to bed once his neighbor left. He gets up for work and he goes to leave without giving me a kiss AGAIN but I ask for one and he gives it to me. I think we are making progress on respecting boundaries. 
I leave and again leave a note ( it’s my thing) explaining that I feel a relationship is about sharing the good AND the bad and that I wanted to be treated how I deserved and that I appreciated him respecting my boundaries to show affection. I explain that I didn’t move here to live with my parents and that I wanted this to work. I let him know I supported his choices no matter what but I don’t know why he didn’t communicate with me. (I also asked if he was going to just dress up as a stork and show up with a child since it didn’t seem like he was going to ever include me in his decisions— I was speaking out of frustration)

I texted him a few days later to let him know I was now an aunt. He didn’t respond. I texted to let him know I missed him so I wanted to come see him the next day— he didn’t respond so I said never mind. Then the next day I let him know was going to come the next day. He didn’t respond but he NEVER does. 

So on Tuesday I drive there and halfway there I let him know I was on my way. He said no. I told him he should have responded the night before. He said he didn’t want to see me. I told him fine I’d get my stuff and leave because I am over his games. He told me no. He said he would put my stuff on the porch and I could get it when he wasn’t home. I’m not going to turn around and I tell him so. He lets me know that I am not welcome and I can’t go in his house. When I get there he’s in his garage. He tells me he isn’t talking to me because I “went through” his stuff. I let him know it was an accident. He refuses to acknowledge me. Then his mom shows up and she proceeds to have a few drinks with him — he completely ignores me and treats me like I don’t exist- his mom tries to include me but I am afraid he will flip out on me and make me leave so I just wait. Except of course she ends up drinking more than usual and can’t drive. She gets up to go to the bathroom so I try to talk to him. I explain to him that I make his bed, do all of his laundry, wash the dishes,make his coffee and touching all of that is ok but I accidentally find out something that I understand was important to him but I should have magically known not to touch it!!??his mom comes back right as we were getting it all out in the table and tries to leave. We both tell her to stay the night and she goes to wait in the house. 

it all leads to THIS : 
I ask my ex if he loves me and he says no. I immediately feel like I’ve been punched in the stomach. At this point I feel no point in talking to him and just want my stuff. I ask him if I can get it and he says no. I told him I wasn’t driving an hr back to get them. I try to talk to him and he basically asked me why I even moved back, why I didn’t have a conversation to clarify moving in with him. I stated that he ASKED me to move in and he just kept making me feel crazy for trusting him and deciding to come back to be with him. He stated he told me not to come that night. I responded that like I said he should have texted me back the night before and he said so you just show up at peoples house ?? WHEN HE IS THE ONE WHO STATED HE HATES HIS PHONE AND TO JUST COME. 
At this point I was just starting to feel like I was having a psychotic break because I was so confused. I tried multiple times to figure out the living arrangement while still in Alaska, flew there to talk to him, and finally figured it could be handled in person since he hates his phone and we weren’t making progress with 4000 miles between us. Things were quickly getting toxic so I told him I was getting my stuff and leaving. I went in and gathered it up, he handed me a few things he had put up and I drove out tired, crying, and heartbroken. 

The thing is if he had been willing to put the effort in to text and call I would have been fine getting my own apartment. I wasn’t in a rush to move in I just was trying to make it work. I want to explain this to him. I love him. I also want nothing to do with him and I’m glad I dodged the bullet. I can’t stop thinking of how fast it all went downhill. I can’t stop feeling like I did a million things wrong. I feel dumb and naive. Disposable. I’m hurt that he could just treat me like this when I have done nothing but try to show unconditional love.

He then refuses to talk to me when he gets off work the next day( Friday) and leaves to spend the night at his best friends house that night. Saturday morning I leave him a note explaining that I cared no matter what but also my boundaries during arguments. For example, I do not believe in withholding affection as a punishment. I also apologize for invading his privacy and explain my perspective. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I leave and then come back in a few days. He has his best friend over in the garage so I just go in the house. His best friend leaves and then his dad comes over. I wait until they’re gone and I go out. I ask for a hug and he gives me one. He tells me he told his dad about his son and it went better than he expected. He didn’t seem angry and I thought we could finally talk about everything. INSTEAD his neighbor comes over and interrupts and they end up getting super stoned. He had to be up early for work and so we just went to bed once his neighbor left. He gets up for work and he goes to leave without giving me a kiss AGAIN but I ask for one and he gives it to me. I think we are making progress on respecting boundaries. 
I leave and again leave a note ( it’s my thing) explaining that I feel a relationship is about sharing the good AND the bad and that I wanted to be treated how I deserved and that I appreciated him respecting my boundaries to show affection. I explain that I didn’t move here to live with my parents and that I wanted this to work. I let him know I supported his choices no matter what but I don’t know why he didn’t communicate with me. (I also asked if he was going to just dress up as a stork and show up with a child since it didn’t seem like he was going to ever include me in his decisions— I was speaking out of frustration)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I texted him a few days later to let him know I was now an aunt. He didn’t respond. I texted to let him know I missed him so I wanted to come see him the next day— he didn’t respond so I said never mind. Then the next day I let him know was going to come the next day. He didn’t respond but he NEVER does. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So on Tuesday I drive there and halfway there I let him know I was on my way. He said no. I told him he should have responded the night before. He said he didn’t want to see me. I told him fine I’d get my stuff and leave because I am over his games. He told me no. He said he would put my stuff on the porch and I could get it when he wasn’t home. I’m not going to turn around and I tell him so. He lets me know that I am not welcome and I can’t go in his house. When I get there he’s in his garage. He tells me he isn’t talking to me because I “went through” his stuff. I let him know it was an accident. He refuses to acknowledge me. Then his mom shows up and she proceeds to have a few drinks with him — he completely ignores me and treats me like I don’t exist- his mom tries to include me but I am afraid he will flip out on me and make me leave so I just wait. Except of course she ends up drinking more than usual and can’t drive. She gets up to go to the bathroom so I try to talk to him. I explain to him that I make his bed, do all of his laundry, wash the dishes,make his coffee and touching all of that is ok but I accidentally find out something that I understand was important to him but I should have magically known not to touch it!!??his mom comes back right as we were getting it all out in the table and tries to leave. We both tell her to stay the night and she goes to wait in the house. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it all leads to THIS : 
I ask my ex if he loves me and he says no. I immediately feel like I’ve been punched in the stomach. At this point I feel no point in talking to him and just want my stuff. I ask him if I can get it and he says no. I told him I wasn’t driving an hr back to get them. I try to talk to him and he basically asked me why I even moved back, why I didn’t have a conversation to clarify moving in with him. I stated that he ASKED me to move in and he just kept making me feel crazy for trusting him and deciding to come back to be with him. He stated he told me not to come that night. I responded that like I said he should have texted me back the night before and he said so you just show up at peoples house ?? WHEN HE IS THE ONE WHO STATED HE HATES HIS PHONE AND TO JUST COME. 
At this point I was just starting to feel like I was having a psychotic break because I was so confused. I tried multiple times to figure out the living arrangement while still in Alaska, flew there to talk to him, and finally figured it could be handled in person since he hates his phone and we weren’t making progress with 4000 miles between us. Things were quickly getting toxic so I told him I was getting my stuff and leaving. I went in and gathered it up, he handed me a few things he had put up and I drove out tired, crying, and heartbroken. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is if he had been willing to put the effort in to text and call I would have been fine getting my own apartment. I wasn’t in a rush to move in I just was trying to make it work. I want to explain this to him. I love him. I also want nothing to do with him and I’m glad I dodged the bullet. I can’t stop thinking of how fast it all went downhill. I can’t stop feeling like I did a million things wrong. I feel dumb and naive. Disposable. I’m hurt that he could just treat me like this when I have done nothing but try to show unconditional love. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sorry it’s so long but I really needed to get it off my chest.&lt;/p&gt;

,BreakUps,"So we broke up, it’s almost been a month and a half since then. It was a mutual break but ended because he (M21) sent dm’s to other girls (which he never truly explain why) and initially called it a mental health crisis but then switched his tune. We went on a break and then decided to break things off.

We decided we were going to be friends (or try to be) which now that I think about it was a bit in mature. I saw him briefly a week after the breakup for 45mins and came to the conclusion that we wouldn’t be able to be as just being around him makes me feel so terrible about myself. We haven’t had any contact but are in school together in a very small program where I’ll see him multiple times a week..along with the girls he messaged this september.

Overall, I know I we weren’t meant to be together. We were together for 1.7yrs and just are very different people but I’m struggling. I’ve dealt with break ups before but this time I don’t feel a need or want to date. I want to get back out there or just move a step away from the relationship I had with him.

,BreakUps,"We’re both college freshmen. I’m M19 and shes F18. Yes, I know lots of high school relationships don’t last. We dated for 10 months. The relationship was great and healthy. 

Here’s some background----
We moved into our college dorms on August 9. A few nights went by. We hanged out, but I could tell she was distant. So, I called her later that night to see if she was fine. She wanted to break up. I went over to her dorm and we talked and cried together from about 11:30PM to 2:30AM. I told her to sleep on it. She did. The next morning she broke up with me. Her eyes were incredibly puffy. So much so that she had to wear sunglasses when walking in public for the day. I wrote a letter to her and gave it to her before she left. Basically it just said thank you for the last 10 months and that I still care for you and wish you well despite no longer being your boyfriend. The following day we went on a run together and discussed the breakup more so I could clearly understand why. She said the letter was sweet.

Here’s her reasoning for the breakup----
We both went to single-gender high schools. I was the only guy that she had ever gotten to know. She said she wasn’t ready for a serious relationship, because she didn’t know if I was her soulmate. She essentially said that she didn’t have any other data points to compare me to. 
She also said that she didn’t feel comfortable talking to other guys while in a relationship. I told her that being friends with guys is completely normal and healthy, but, she said she felt dirty when talking to new guys that could be friends. 
She also mentioned that her mom and dad broke up in college temporarily. Here’s some more background. Her mom and dad both went to the same 2 single-gender high schools that we went to. They both met at the same high schools as we did. They both went to the same college that we currently attend. So, I have a feeling that this influenced her decision. In fact, she was on the phone with her mom prior to me coming over that one night when she proposed breaking up.
She also said that she’d rather break up now and possibly get back together in the future than break up later when we’ve dated for 1+ years because it’ll hurt more if that happened. 

Here’s some positive things that she mentioned -----
I asked her if I did anything wrong, and she said no. She stressed that I was the nicest guy that she’s ever met and may ever meet. She also stressed that she wasn’t leaving me for someone else. She wasn’t looking for a relationship right now. She wants to remain friends and be able to make friends of all genders comfortably. (Although, I think we’re both doing No Contact because we still have feelings for each other... which confuses me because why would you break up with someone you still have feelings for?)

Now for the background of our relationship -----
I was good to her. I know that’s easy to say, but we were really great. We were each other’s first kiss, and I asked her before kissing her. I always treated her well. I was a gentleman. I always opened the car door for her. I always ensured that she was comfortable when we were being intimate in any way. I drove to her house, one hour away, just to drop off flowers and a stuffed animal when she got her wisdom teeth taken out. We were comfortable around each other. We made so many great memories. Most importantly, we shared the same values.

Basically, I’m trying to understand this. Frankly, her reasoning makes some sense to me, but it still stings. I still have feelings for her, so knowing that other guys can hit on her and possibly date her and kiss her is killing me. I miss the daily phone calls, the emotional connection, and I miss my best friend. I'm sad that I didn’t get to take her on a date in college. The week prior I had bought a pair of boots and boot-cut jeans. The boots were picked out with some special colors (green, yellow, and white) because they’re a combination of our high schools’ colors. This new set of clothes, that she didn't know about, was for a date that I had planned for the weekend of my birthday (5 days after she broke up with me). I’ve been in no contact for 9 days now though. I just deleted Snapchat permanently and muted her instagram account in case she posts anything. I also deleted her texts because I was scrolling through them too much.


Does her reasoning sound good to y’all? Or am I just biased due to my feelings for her? How do I proceed? Of course, the answer is no contact, but do I break it once I’m emotionally stable in a month or however long that takes? How long do I have to wait before trying to take her out on a date? Do I break it to initiate a friendship? Should I wait until she contacts me (hopefully realizing that I’m her soulmate)? I made it clear to her that I think she’s the one for me when I last saw her and that if she realizes that I'm the one then she should reach out. I just need all the advice that I can get.

&lt;p&gt;I wish I didn’t care. I wish I could move on, but I still feel there’s some kind of hope that we’ll get back together some day. &lt;/p&gt;

,BreakUps,"We both met online and got into a long distance relationship for 6 months. This was the first romantic relationship for both of us. Things started off very passionate and well. He was deeply attracted to me based on my emotional openness about my mental health struggles and trauma, and I was attracted to his strong outward confidence. However, as time went on he buried himself more into work/school and became less emotionally available, while I got progressively needier. I have this nasty cycle where I get close with people really quickly, then become scared of being not good enough and abandoned by them. I’d do my best to voice my needs for affection; he didn’t fully understand them but would try to accommodate me. Later on he told me he noticed I was struggling with a number of issues, but he didn’t see abandonment as being productive and wanted to help me change. I also got jealous about how he’d talk a lot to this other group of people and not spend time with me, so sometimes I’d act passive-aggressive or use other issues to channel my frustration. He kept saying he was too busy with his life and couldn’t deal with a full relationship, so eventually he broke up with me in January, but we remained close friends and regularly talked until late April ish. I still had lingering feelings, and he’d give off signs here and there that he did too, but he said he had moved on.

In April, there was a situation where I thought he betrayed my trust and told someone. I got really mad and a lot of the pent-up resentment came pouring out. I said how he didn’t cared to hang out with me, that he cared about these friends more than me, and that he always had this holier-than-thou attitude and never admitted he was wrong. We stopped talking after that. 

I reached out after a few months, telling him about the full extent of what I felt during the time we talked (e.g. the jealousy, need for affection, not feeling good enough, etc). I also apologized for what I said, told him what feelings sparked those angry remarks, that I didn’t mean it, how I actually felt about him, what I’m doing to work on myself (e.g. therapy), and asking if he felt comfortable reconnecting with me. He seems genuinely glad that I’m making these positive changes, but said he still felt hurt by what I said and didn’t feel comfortable reconnecting. A week later he told me he had thought about it some more and felt more comfortable with us going our separate ways. 

I recently learned a lot about attachment theory and believe I display a mix of secure and anxious attachment while he’s dismissive avoidant. I understand much of my actions were protest behaviour trying to get the other party to provide me with love and affection. I feel he’s dismissive avoidant because he’s said he finds it hard to be emotionally vulnerable, never really shared his feelings, always stepped back whenever there was conflict, often didn’t say anything when issues arise, etc. I’ve been wondering why he feels so hurt by what I said, because it didn’t seem THAT bad. I’m not justifying it, but he’s usually so stoic and understanding of the world around him, it’s surprising. I was wondering if anyone had insight into this. Thank you in advance.

,BreakUps,"3 months ago I got broken up with. Out of the blue completely. We were going to move in together after a 5 year relationship the next month. In my eyes, everything was perfect but he realized he wasn’t ready to settle down and that the spark wasn’t there anymore for him. I was heartbroken to the point where I didn’t think I could be happy again. I went through all the cliches: no sleeping, no eating, laying in bed all day and crying every minute. After about 1,5 months of this gut wrenching feeling, my mood changed. I suddenly felt extremely positive and started making really spontaneous life choices. I didn’t accept the breakup yet, or was over him, I just needed a new way of dealing with it. This also wasn’t healthy. After that, the sadness came back, but it hit me so much harder because I thought I was doing well. Nobody prepared me for the rollercoaster of a breakup. The ups and downs were awful.

Until about a week ago. I woke up one day and felt.. okay. I wasn’t sad. I was’t overly excited. But I also felt more like myself than I had felt in months. This phase I’m in right now describes the state between being heartbroken and being over your ex. I’m not over the situation, I’m no way ready to start dating again or forgetting his existence. But I’m getting there. And knowing I’m on a uphill slope, feels pretty damn great. Getting sad is normal, but knowing your worth and feeling yourself adjusting to your new way of living is a wonderful feeling. 

So my advice, don’t pressure yourself into being over them, but experience every phase you’ll go through during a breakup. Know that every step you take forward should be celebrated and appreciated. You’re not over him? That’s okay! You’re feeling a bit better than yesterday? Go you! You’re sad? Take in the emotions and know there are better times ahead.

,BreakUps,"  

Not even sure if I can call this last relationship a relationship because the guy I was dating never wanted to commit and make it official. It sure had all the makings of a relationship though, he even told me he loved me 3 months in. So, when he broke things off a few weeks ago it hurt like hell. After dating on and off for 6 months it officially feels over. It’s been the most confusing rollercoaster of emotions these past 6 months. Some of the highest highs I’ve ever felt in a “relationship”, but also some of the lowest lows. At the end of it all, he still could not commit. We had a huge fight which led to him saying he needed some time away from me. I don’t know what the future holds for us, but I am finally giving him the space he says he needs while also, for what feels like the first time in my life, giving myself the space I need to heal from all this. 

I’ve been in countless official, serious relationships before, 4 to be exact, but none of them felt as real as this one did even if we didn’t have the title. Maybe I’m fooling myself in saying that, but that’s how it feels for me at this very moment. With that being said, that’s why this break up feels like the first real break up I’ve ever experienced.

,BreakUps,"This feels like the hardest breakup I’ve ever gone through...ironically the shortest relationship too (go figure).
2.5 weeks since break up - must have been the 7th or 8th time she’d “broken up” with me. She’d lose her mind and get frustrated every time I’d try to communicate an issue. I’m no saint, I understand I can be a pain in the ass, but I genuinely would attempt to calmly communicate things and she would blow up and always just break up instead of being able to talk. It’s been a fucking rollercoaster, but this time feels real. Sshe’d broken up over the phone the week prior, blocked my phone and all social media and would not speak to me. Then called a few days later to “forgive me” and say it’s done. I reached out on Friday, we talked on the phone briefly, did not go that well. We hadn’t spoken in a week.
We’d spoken on the phone Sunday as well, I’d had a emotional breakdown that day, and she was nice enough to talk to me. We’d also texted after that night, pretty much me explaining we need to have a closure talk and there’s also a few things of mine I’d like returned.
Her reasons for breaking up were “i told you not to wait around because i’m moving on with my life and i want you to as well. i don’t want to be in a relationship. with you, with anyone. it all seemed to change overnight because i was tired of trying. i gave up. i’m not trying again. it was too much for me. emotionally &amp; mentality and i don’t want to deal/ go through that again. call it running, i call it protecting myself.” She has also said on our phone calls she’s still in love with me, she misses her best friend and is sad, she misses us, she wants us to still be friends, etc. 
Yes, I’ve texted after that..never anything mean, ever. Always just trying to reason, and actually have a discussion. But, no response. I’ve texted her once a day, mainly talks from Esther Perel, as I’ve learned quite a bit about her from this subreddit. Usually just once a day the past few days.
I know I always read go NC, but this person has come back from the other break ups we’ve had from me reaching out and being a voice of reason. This time is so different because it’s been almost 3 weeks. She doesn’t reach out, doesn’t respond. Told me she’ll let me know when she has time to see me and return my things because she’s made herself extremely busy the next few weeks. That’s fine.
I’m freaking out and don’t know what to do. It’s all I think about through every single day. I don’t usually dream, but I started dreaming again the night she ended it, and the dreams are ALWAYS about her, every night. All I want to do is make this work, continue to grow, continue to move forward. My anxiety is past 100, so fucking depressed.

But, he can’t be upset if he’s the one who broke up with me right?

,BreakUps,"Back story (might be long sorry but ill try keep it short) she went home for lockdown (3 hours away) and at first was fine, facetiming everyday, chatting, laughing, playing games, watching films ect. Then all of a sudden she decided she wanted to go to university near her home and live with her two friends, and didnt want me to move there as it was too soon? (We’d been living together since like 2 months in, had promise rings to marry, wanted kids, had a perfect relationship, minus the typical relationship squabbles, never a huge fight or anything) Since that decision she went distant and started ignoring me for days at a time. Filling me with anxiety and worry i asked her about it and told her it was upsetting me to which i got called manipulative?!? For expressing that it was upsetting me? 

Fast forward through this shit time for two months i have moved into a new flat with a friend, she had to come and collect her stuff from my home home, and thats when she broke up with me. Her reason was she needed to be alone and needed time to herself to figure herself out. It was a really loving breakup but right now i wish id have fought more instead of accepted it to respect her and be a bit of a pushover (i did everything for her in relationship, paid for everything, made her happy when she was sad with flowers and her fave films, did everything for her yano?) We had texts for the first few days that weee loving and she said things like “ill be better for you in the future” and “its not over for us” but now, its nothing, and couldnt get a simple reply to anything small. 

Its really hard for me to accept her reason as i feel she maybe fell out of love with me during lockdown, or she wanted to be single to go to uni, either is totally justifiable and i wouldnt wanna take someones freedom and young life away from them and she was insanely beautiful so will be surrounded by guys wanting her attention, which i would have been fine with coz i trusted her. 

But its really hard to not think about all the things she now might be up to, who shes with, if shes moved on blah blah. I miss her so much and its really hard to not reach out and see if we can fix it? I know 11 months isnt super long for a relationship but for me, this was the one, where we had our futures planned and i really really really wanted to marry her, never looked or thought about another woman, i was so happy with her even when she wasnt supporting my mental health! 

i’ve been doing everything i can to help myself, had therapy, got new hobbies, focus on work and myself, watch a million youtube vids blah blah but holy f*** when does it end? When do i reach out after no contact? Should i have fought?

,BreakUps,"Hey everyone. I'm here to vent, express myself, and get your wonderful opinions. I'm 27 and just got dumped by my ex of only four months. Yes, I know what you're thinking, four months is really short. I agree. Honestly though, this breakup is the most painful that I have endured. Before her, I was with someone for 3 years (ex-fiance) and another for 1.5 years (ex-girlfriend). I feel crushed and lost. With this lady, I gave it my all. I was incredibly good to her. I did her dishes, cleaned her apartment, took her places, bought her groceries, support her, was kind and generous, and so much more. I applied myself because I truly truly loved her. It happened all quickly. We met on Hinge and we had a mutual friend. We instantly clicked; she was beautiful, loved to play games, was really nice, liked yoga and fitness, driven, had goals/aspirations and such. We were already talking about moving in and getting married. It felt so so right, I was the happiest I have ever been in a long time. Around the second month, we started having problems. I made some mistakes, jokes I shouldn't have made that I thought were funny but really hurt her. I apologized and swore never to make them again. I worked on being more empathetic and kind and helpful.

She became gradually meaner and meaner and made me feel worthless. It felt like she never got used to me being around her, like a nuisance. I started getting really self-conscious. She had pictures of her ex on the IG and she wouldn't take them down or even post one picture of us together. She bossed me around and put me down so many times. I kept being patient with her and I really wanted it to work. She would have intense fits of rage for the smallest things. She got made at me for getting her flowers, she would kick her dog and cat in her anger, and throw things at me. I just don't know why? So what I ran the tap for a bit longer? So what I didn't do the dishes just like you want them to be done. I don't get it... We went camping a few times and worked so hard to pack things and she got mad at me for packing one extra piece of dog meat. Like what? I have my things to work on like being a good listener and I'm honestly trying. Eventually all of this led to a huge fight at the lake when I told her to spend more time with me as she wanted to spend all of her time with her family. I totally respect that and left her alone for the majority of the time. She just didn't seem interested. When we finally did spend time, she was busy taking dog photos near the lake. I kept telling her to put her phone away but she wouldn't budge. When we got back to the city, she broke up with me. I literally begged her not to and for the whole month I've been trying to get back but she won't budge. I just don't get it. I tried to learn from previous relationships and love her and be good with her but it just wasn't enough.

I feel heartbroken, feeling like an absolute failure and unloveable. It brings back all of the previous relationships to the forefront. I don't get it. In retrospection, I guess I was needy. I was seeking out her attention to feel loved and accepted as this is something I've longed for. I felt so happy with her. I'm also a teacher so I had the summer off and I honestly just wanted to make beautiful memories together. Sucks it didn't work out. I feel so sad. Cried almost every day. The thought of her being with other guys kills me. I can't even imagine being with someone else. I tried Tinder and I just couldn't stomach it one bit. I'm sick of the dating game but I really would like a partner to share a vision and build each other in this short life we have. I don't know what to do. I've been reading books about relationships and being more positive. I want to be a good partner, I have a good heart. I've always wanted to be a husband and a father one day to a loving wife. Feels like a fantasy. I'm sure theres some details missing her and I'm happy to share more. Thanks for letting me spill my heart out. Opinions are encouraged! :)

I tried to learn from previous relationships and love her and be good with her but it just wasn&amp;#39;t enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel heartbroken, feeling like an absolute failure and unloveable. It brings back all of the previous relationships to the forefront. I don&amp;#39;t get it. In retrospection, I guess I was needy. I was seeking out her attention to feel loved and accepted as this is something I&amp;#39;ve longed for. I felt so happy with her. I&amp;#39;m also a teacher so I had the summer off and I honestly just wanted to make beautiful memories together. Sucks it didn&amp;#39;t work out. I feel so sad. Cried almost every day. The thought of her being with other guys kills me. I can&amp;#39;t even imagine being with someone else. I tried Tinder and I just couldn&amp;#39;t stomach it one bit. I&amp;#39;m sick of the dating game but I really would like a partner to share a vision and build each other in this short life we have. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I&amp;#39;ve been reading books about relationships and being more positive. I want to be a good partner, I have a good heart. I&amp;#39;ve always wanted to be a husband and a father one day to a loving wife. Feels like a fantasy. I&amp;#39;m sure theres some details missing her and I&amp;#39;m happy to share more. Thanks for letting me spill my heart out. Opinions are encouraged! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Got dumped. Feeling heartbroken and lost. Don&amp;#39;t know what to do anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

,BreakUps,"So, it all started roughly 6 years ago. I didn\`t know my ex-GF beforehand, but found out through one of her friends she was really into me. Several attempts to hook us up and subtle advances from her followed.  I was hesitant of dating her because I was interested in someone else back then. Also, I couldn\`t bring myself to hurt her by rejecting her.  Eventually I gave in, we started dating and I slowly fell in love. After a few years of living together we started making plans for the future, discussed our wedding, having kids etc.

I don\`t want to make the post too long so I\`ll just say she started to have problems in the relationship , which she didn\`t communicate. Instead of trying to work things out she overlapped with a co-worker and left me last January.

It really messed me up, It has been over a year since she left and I\`m still not over it, still feeling betrayed. I don\`t follow her on social media, but I know from common friends she is living happily with the other guy. They bought a new place together and are planning to get married next year.

,BreakUps,"I dont really know if I should post this here, but I think I just need to talk about it. sit down take a coffee or something else to drink because this is a long story.

first some context. Im bisexual with a male lean, and I am a furry, yhea now laugh and cringe but whatever.
It all started I think three years ago, I met this guy Ill just call him jason or smthing idk. jason and I got really close and he just got out of a breakup, I was there for him I helped him, played daily with him called daily and we got really close, so close to the point I started meeting him, jason he lived in the netherlands and I lived in belgium but I still tried to visit him a lot of times sometimes even every two weeks in the weekends. I cared a lot about him and at that point I did have  a boyfriend but well lets say that wasnt going that well, my bf at that time was a bit of a weird guy and we didnt really fit together but he was still a good friend of me and jason. jason he well now got his own boyfriend not so long after that, but we where still close as possible. We even got to the point we had regulary sex and such our boyfriends knew of it and it was fine since I also did stuff with jasons boyfriend and such. But after a while we grew closer and closer me and jason and we kinda wanted to have a relationship, but we didnt because we didnt want to hurt the ppl around us and also didnt want to loose them as friends so we didnt tell anyone. his mother knew we had a relationship but others didnt.well it went this way for a while, and I was more about having a closed relationship with a few outsiders in it like really good friends and such, he said he also agreed to that. He said he loved me and that hed always talk with me about it but that was a lie. I dont know how many times but he did stuff a lot with other people behind my back. we got into a lot of fights but somehow always managed to get out of it. then the first big incident happened. it was in august 3 years ago . jason went to a friend or better said friends they where a couple and he did some sexual stuff over there. he asked me and it was fine I also knew who they where,and I became friends with them myself. later after I finished my student job id also come for a weekend together with jason, since jason and I had plans to travel around the netherlands and visit a lot of friends. but when we where there a lot of stuff happened and the guy Im gone call him cerby. he wasnt happy, I didnt know why, afterwards I heard it was because I pulled a move on his boyfriend, wich at the time I didnt understand since I well asked him clearly if it was okai to do stuff with his boyfriend and such. he said it was fin, but afterwards it wasnt, so he started spreading lies, I didnt tell jason about it that I knew it because I didnt want to make it hard for him, but I should have because jason and cerby where friends and tbh they where friend just because cerby had a huge cock, not like a normal sised or a big one but a huge one. jason, was way too obsessed with sex and didnt care about anything else. but well a lot of stuff happened he didnt support me in the fight with cerby and I felt left alone. this was the first big dent in our relationship. after that I never felt supported by him and he never really did support me I suppose.well a few months went past, and stuff went from bad to worser me and jasons relationship soured, he started cheating more and more on me. he didnt breakup with his fake boyfriend neither did I. we had so much lies around us. but we still kinda loved eachother, well at least I loved him, he only loved what I gave him. the support, the love, the stuff etc. I think the second big dent in our relationship was februari. we went to a kindoff party a furry party. He got asked by a guy to stay after the party and go have sex with him. I didnt want that to happen, but I didnt tell him, I told him to choose himself but I clearly didnt like the entire idea of him going. I hated it, I hated forcing him to choose, I felt bad for making him choose, me or that friend. I didnt want to be the person that made him choose, I never wanted to be and I wanted him to choose for me. He didnt choose for me and went to have sex with the guy afterwards. at least he came back to the hotel around 3 o clock that night, I dont know what I wouldv done if he didnt came back. we cuddled and I cried all night. next morning we woke up and went back to his house, I then went back to my house and we didnt really talk about it. Our relationship was damaged beyond repair at that point and it only went worser and worser, I started to feel depressed and went in a bad mood, and he went to go cheat even more on me. it reached a climax at wich I said I didnt want him to hookup with someone while we where somewhere, I didnt want him to go have sex with random people while I was sitting there alone, he got fed up with me and broke up with me, he blocked me and we didnt talk for a bit. until well we kinda where friends again, until well he went alone to that event and I heard he went to the bday party of cerby, the guy that was already trying for months to destroy my online life and talk as bad as possible about me. I freaked that evening, I heard that from the fake bf from jason that he would go there since wel jason didnt dare to tell me that, I freakd on him shouted on him called his mom and exposed everything he did the slut he was, jason got mad at me and we didnt talk for more then a month, I got so pissed I even exposed him to his fake bf, he heard the truth and got sad and broke up with him, at that time I got closer with him, Ill call him joey. joey and me got closer and closer, he also came from the netherlands, and since I had vacation I was there almost every weekend. until the point he and I got a relationship.we where happy for a while. until a day jason contacted me again, I was pissed at him, he was pissed at me, we shouted we cried, we kissed and we made up a bit, I kept him at a distance, I saw the regret in his eyes, I thought he really was sorry. but I wasnt going to just accept him back he had to work for it, we got close again pretty quickly but joey was my real bf at that point he and I where close, and he was still mad asf on jason I tried to fix them, idk why that was a big mistake tbh.

sorry gone stop here for today since I dont feel that well and can barely keep my tears in my eyes, this is a short summary of maybe 1/5th of a story wich just kept going on with me being hurt over and over again....

,BreakUps,"So about a month ago, I started to feel my ex being distant from me. So I mirrored her emotions and just backed off when she seemed distant.

One day, she messaged me asking ""hey been having a hard week. Wondering if we can talk tonight?"" She came over and I anticipated a break up. She said she still loves me and cares about me but wants to go a bit slower and needs some **""SPACE""**. Which is something I find weird, because I only see her once or twice a week at most. Even when I do see her, she'll be on her phone half the time texting and has to leave early or something like that. So she isn't exactly spending quality time with me.

She continued to tell me she felt overwhelmed whenever my mom talks about us having kids and such. She feels like she is obligated to see me every week when I tell her she shouldn't feel that way and she should do whatever she wants.

A few days pass and she messages me to see how I am doing and she would even post on her instagram story. I would never look at it but I would reply.

A few days fter that, I had enough of this and decided to end things. I sent her a text saying ""we are done"". She comes over and drops off my stuff and I give her her stuff back in return.

We had a talk and I was crying. I told her that this isn't a relationship if she has to tell me these things last second rather than telling me when it's happening. Communication is key to a good relationship. She told me she struggled with it because shes a people pleaser. I asked her if she even sees me in her life. She replied ""I don't know"". Then I told her its over because I want to be with someone who can see me in their life.

I wished her the best in life and I told her that she is an amazing woman and I genuinely hope she can find happiness in herself. I told her good luck in life and stay safe. Also said, if she ever changes her mind to call me. She told me that I am super amazing and she wished me the best too. She kinda cried but not as much as me.

Its been nearly 2 weeks since we broke up.

The first few days were harsh on me. I cried, hardly ate anything and forced myself to go out, blocked her on social media, unfriended her sister, and then disconnected from social media for a MINIMUM of 1 month.

I already feel better. I still do miss her but I need to move on with my life. Plenty of fish in the sea. Just heartbreak sucks.

,BreakUps,"Yes I broke up with you and you're allowed to be mad at me. I expected it, I understand it. I blindsided you and moved out quickly which was wrong of me (but I continued paying rent so you could stay). At the time I didn't really know why I did it but looking back I now have the clearest possible picture. You were emotionally manipulative, you made me feel bad because my parents were well off and helped pay for college. You pressured me into paying for lots of things in our relationship that I wasn't comfortable with, and I'm not talking about gifts. You made me feel bad for asking to split the internet bill when we lived together for one. You blamed me for making you feel worse about your insecurities when I would do nothing but give my all into reassuring you during our relationship and making you feel loved. You simply rejected my help and professional help. Most of the time you didn't even remember what it was that I unintentionally said and you could never forgive me even if I tried to make things right.

Post breakup you turned toxic. I tried to be understanding and respectful of your wishes, because I cared about you and it hurt me to see you the way you were. Even after you started a new serious relationship less than a week after I left I couldn't really be mad at you and was kind. You seemed to appreciate it but suddenly you turned on me. You repeatedly rubbed your new relationship in my face and publicized it when you wouldn't even use a profile picture of the two of us for more than a week while we dated. I'd ask for space but you'd always come back and message me. Then you ""drunk"" texted me to tell me that you're thankful that I broke up with you, that it was ""the best thing you never knew you needed."" It was clear you wanted me gone so I asked for my security deposit back respectfully. I knew that the landlord was still holding it and that you'd have to find the money elsewhere (because you told your new roommate that they didn't need to pay one), but I was also more than willing to give you more time. Whenever I brought it up before though you'd always deflect or find a way to make it seem like I didn't deserve to get it back. But still, I was willing to wait, I just didn't want to be disrespected. Then you called me a joke to my face, so I just decided to cut my losses. I calmly and respectfully told you that I couldn't stand to be mistreated anymore and blocked you.

The day after this you went and posted a cropped image of my final message on twitter, a message that edited, made me seem like a terrible, condescending person. You captioned it with lies, saying that I ""tried to illegally evict you,"" ""talked shit behind your back"" (in reality venting to one of my closest, most trusted friends over text, which you read while I was asleep), and weaponized your mental illness when I had done none of these things. My friends tried to defend me but then you blocked them after the first several replies. You eventually deleted the tweet but I believe that the damage was done. You'd smeared my image publicly whereas I had only told my close group of friends. Despite this, I distanced myself and went no contact.

It's been about a month now and I've started to feel like myself again. I'm still sad from time to time because I loved you and cherish the good times we had, but I couldn't stand being unhappy anymore. Then today you called me from a private number because you knew I'd pick up without suspecting anything. You asked for your concert tickets to be transferred and then told me that you don't appreciate how I made my friends think that you ""stole"" my money because they ""publicly attacked"" you on twitter. I apologized for it because I was anxious and put on the spot but I also didn't know what to say. I was baffled because you had publicly attacked me first and knew that I couldn't respond after deactivating my twitter. You accused them of having incomplete context when in reality they had seen the complete text transcripts, whereas the same couldn't be said for your twitter followers. And above all else, when I had discussed the security deposit in the past you would always deflect and give sarcastic, non-committal answers, which made it seem pretty clear that you weren't intending on giving it back at least until you moved out, if at all.

I left this subreddit a few weeks ago because her actions made it easier for me to move on, but after today it's clear that she knows how to reach me and hit where it hurts no matter how hard I try to get away from her.

,BreakUps,"I don’t know what it was, but something is different now. I saw a picture of you, with him, and it didn’t floor me. It felt weird, but also ok. I realized how much you’ve changed, and also how much my perception of you was never who you really were. Does it still hurt that you felt 3 years wasn’t worth trying to fix rather than just running to someone new? Yea. Do I still miss the way you fit into my family and that innocent connection and love we had. Of course. But at the end of the day, being with someone else and running from our problems was easier for you than facing them and working through them like I wanted to. That doesn’t make you a bad person, but it just makes you the wrong person for me. 

I don’t regret the time we had together, you helped me grow - and I’m probably still not totally ready for something new yet, but I’m gonna try and see if there’s something I like. I miss the fantasy future I’d envisioned for us, but that’s all it ever was; a fantasy.

I truly do care about you and hope you actually deal with your insecurities one day; I know you better than you think and I can see you’re just running from them. But I don’t know what’s best for you and maybe this is how you’re coping. Best of luck. I hope one day you see in yourself what I saw in you, and find someone else who sees it too. 

Here’s to hoping the rest of my healing journey is less painful than the road that took me here. And I hope whoever’s reading this takes some hope from this that things do turn around.

I saw a picture of you, with him, and it didn’t floor me. It felt weird, but also ok. I realized how much you’ve changed, and also how much my perception of you was never who you really were. Does it still hurt that you felt 3 years wasn’t worth trying to fix rather than just running to someone new? Yea. Do I still miss the way you fit into my family and that innocent connection and love we had. Of course. But at the end of the day, being with someone else and running from our problems was easier for you than facing them and working through them like I wanted to. That doesn’t make you a bad person, but it just makes you the wrong person for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t regret the time we had together, you helped me grow - and I’m probably still not totally ready for something new yet, but I’m gonna try and see if there’s something I like. I miss the fantasy future I’d envisioned for us, but that’s all it ever was; a fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I truly do care about you and hope you actually deal with your insecurities one day; I know you better than you think and I can see you’re just running from them. But I don’t know what’s best for you and maybe this is how you’re coping. Best of luck. I hope one day you see in yourself what I saw in you, and find someone else who sees it too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s to hoping the rest of my healing journey is less painful than the road that took me here. And I hope whoever’s reading this takes some hope from this that things do turn around.

**TL;DR: Should I contact my ex girlfriend on our (former) anniversary in 2 days?**

I still do love her. She broke up with me. It's been difficult, and I reached out within the first 2 weeks twice, but haven't since. I am hardly optimistic that things could ever mend, and if so it would be challenging regardless because she started a new life in a city slightly further away. She is much more black and white with her choices, and so once she commits (or decommits) to a decision, it's basically all in. I do understand this reality......no matter how painful it is.

*Basic summary above, more detailed below.*

Over the past month, I've gone from (pseudo) acceptance to trainwreck to existential crisis to growth to confusion, it's been quite the cycle.

My ex and I dated for nearly 4 years, and in that time my life, career, and worldview has developed immensely. I graduated, have worked now two different professional jobs, lived close to her, then lived further away (\~2hrs) but still a reasonable distance. At the same time, she was going through professional school and just 2 months ago began what will be a tremendously arduous but fulfilling career, and I couldn't be prouder. Not just because of her accomplishments, but also because of her. Her growth and passion, her drive and joy--all while also staying true to herself and being the same person in many ways I fell in love with on a whim many years ago.

I hoped to move forward with her in this life, and in the meantime I always supported her pursuits while also taking the time before we would go off to follow her dreams to tackle career opportunity I knew I would regret if I didn't give it a shot. Now, once it came down to the wire, I wasn't able to immediately join her in her new location based on my commitments at work. From what we've discussed and she explained to me, she felt rejected and uncertain in me because I wasn't there with her. We absolutely have different attachment styles, and these past 4 years of being committed best friends, talking every day, traveling everywhere together, and seeing each other with frequency--but not living together--have taken a toll on her, even though they've been exactly what I needed while building my experience.

I regret not communicating better. I regret not being there more. But regret is fleeting. I loved every time I was able to make our lives whole, and that's also something to cherish. I'm growing personally daily, being more intentional about my decisions, actions, and future intent. She criticized these things at the end, but also always sought to help me grow as well (as did I with her). I miss her endlessly, but I also have a strong support system outside of our relationship, so it isn't all a wash.

,BreakUps,"When I turned 24 years old, you came into my life. All these years of struggling with obesity, loneliness, feeling like an outcast. Busting my ass off to lose over 200 pounds, hitting the gym, discovering a new world. 

You were one of my first discoveries in this new world I stepped into. You didn’t care about the loose skin, you didn’t care I was a virgin. The way you looked at was so foreign, nobody had ever looked at me like that. You had your bagage too, I didn’t care. We went into it head first. 

I was on top of the world, I had won the jackpot, now it was my turn to experience this part of life, to be happy. Haha, what an idiot I was. 

So many red flags I ignored, glossed over, justified for you. It was never about me, was it? It was about the life you had envisioned for yourself, and you were looking for someone to fulfill that life. Living close to your parents, friends, family, buying a house at 24 instead of just renting an apartment to start our life together. You pressured me into giving you the answers. When are we moving in together? When are we having babies? 

You knew I wanted those things too, I was just scared to give you an answer. We had been dating for 10 months at that point, I was fresh our of college starting my first job, everything was changing, you were my first. I noticed the weird behavior and it made me hesitant. 

You were always silently judging me, pointing out my shortcomings while I was too busy overlooking yours. I wasn’t perfect, I was moody when I was tired. I’m an introvert, sometimes I just want to stay in, not doing anything, just recharging. 

Nobody ever told you no in your life. I noticed that in the first couple of months. An only child surrounded by enablers, an explosive cocktail. There was no room for my emotions or plans or dreams, it was always about you. Your idea of compromise was letting me decide where we slept, what we ate, what movie we watched. My idea of compromise was looking for a house close to your parents, rejecting job offers across the country, abandoning friends that you didn’t vibe with. 

You broke up with me out of the blue, while I was on vacation with my friends. I knew it was gonna bust one day. We constantly had arguments over absolutely nothing, about stuff you fabricated and I had no control over. When I asked you why it was that you were always the one being upset with me you said “you always give me reasons to be upset”. That should’ve been the indicator that you were just a wolf in sheep’s clothing, a manipulative witch that had me in her spell. I stayed, worked harder, changed myself even more for you, it was never enough. 

After we broke up I had so many questions, so many doubts, I just wanted to talk to you to get some answers, some form of closure. How can we go from lets get married and have kids to please leave me alone in the span of 4 days? You were so cold and distant all of a sudden, such a 180 from the girl I knew. 

You told me you would be willing to talk to me when you were ready. I agreed, I waited. For a whole month I waited. I asked again, you weren’t ready. I couldn’t take it anymore, I went over to your house, I rang the bell. 

Seeing you standing there was so weird. Talking to you was so alien to me. You had the face of the girl I loved with all my heart, but what you said didn’t reflect that girl at all. After one month, you told me you were so glad to be single again, you told me you miss cuddling on the couch with someone, just not me. You told me you had certain demand I couldn’t meet. You told me I held you back in life. Girl, I would’ve completely put my life on hold just so you could have yours. You looked me straight in the eye and told me you didn’t want me anymore. You told me you hoped I would’ve never followed up on my request for closure, you were never planning on contacting me again.

All these years of struggling with obesity, loneliness, feeling like an outcast. Busting my ass off to lose over 200 pounds, hitting the gym, discovering a new world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You were one of my first discoveries in this new world I stepped into. You didn’t care about the loose skin, you didn’t care I was a virgin. The way you looked at was so foreign, nobody had ever looked at me like that. You had your bagage too, I didn’t care. We went into it head first. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was on top of the world, I had won the jackpot, now it was my turn to experience this part of life, to be happy. Haha, what an idiot I was. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many red flags I ignored, glossed over, justified for you. It was never about me, was it? It was about the life you had envisioned for yourself, and you were looking for someone to fulfill that life. Living close to your parents, friends, family, buying a house at 24 instead of just renting an apartment to start our life together. You pressured me into giving you the answers. When are we moving in together? When are we having babies? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You knew I wanted those things too, I was just scared to give you an answer. We had been dating for 10 months at that point, I was fresh our of college starting my first job, everything was changing, you were my first. I noticed the weird behavior and it made me hesitant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You were always silently judging me, pointing out my shortcomings while I was too busy overlooking yours. I wasn’t perfect, I was moody when I was tired. I’m an introvert, sometimes I just want to stay in, not doing anything, just recharging. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody ever told you no in your life. I noticed that in the first couple of months. An only child surrounded by enablers, an explosive cocktail. There was no room for my emotions or plans or dreams, it was always about you. Your idea of compromise was letting me decide where we slept, what we ate, what movie we watched. My idea of compromise was looking for a house close to your parents, rejecting job offers across the country, abandoning friends that you didn’t vibe with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You broke up with me out of the blue, while I was on vacation with my friends. I knew it was gonna bust one day. We constantly had arguments over absolutely nothing, about stuff you fabricated and I had no control over. When I asked you why it was that you were always the one being upset with me you said “you always give me reasons to be upset”. That should’ve been the indicator that you were just a wolf in sheep’s clothing, a manipulative witch that had me in her spell. I stayed, worked harder, changed myself even more for you, it was never enough. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we broke up I had so many questions, so many doubts, I just wanted to talk to you to get some answers, some form of closure. How can we go from lets get married and have kids to please leave me alone in the span of 4 days? You were so cold and distant all of a sudden, such a 180 from the girl I knew. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You told me you would be willing to talk to me when you were ready. I agreed, I waited. For a whole month I waited. I asked again, you weren’t ready. I couldn’t take it anymore, I went over to your house, I rang the bell. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing you standing there was so weird. Talking to you was so alien to me. You had the face of the girl I loved with all my heart, but what you said didn’t reflect that girl at all. After one month, you told me you were so glad to be single again, you told me you miss cuddling on the couch with someone, just not me. You told me you had certain demand I couldn’t meet. You told me I held you back in life. Girl, I would’ve completely put my life on hold just so you could have yours. You looked me straight in the eye and told me you didn’t want me anymore. You told me you hoped I would’ve never followed up on my request for closure, you were never planning on contacting me again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who even are you? I don’t know anymore. Maybe I loved someone that never existed. My friends and family told me they knew you would be capable of this. I guess I was blind. &lt;/p&gt;

,BreakUps,"Hey all,

I (20M) recently broke up with my first long-term (1 year, 3 months), serious girlfriend (23F). We had our share of differences including, cultural, familial, religious, and sexual. I didn't think that these things could really divide us - I know it's a bit cheese but I always thought if two people really loved each other, they could make it work. In the end, it dawned on me that she just needed someone to be there with her (she was an international student from Taiwan). She's very emotionally dependent on people, and when we were together, I felt like her protector (felt amazing). 

When we spent time, I always took her out for food, drinks, and we'd study together. I don't think she really loved me either - she shielded her parents from me and I never met them, even over the phone. She's put me down sometimes, has trouble saying 'I love you' because she's ""shy"", etc. She practically lived at my family's place though, staying 3-5 days a week and getting close with my family. Recently she finally landed a job down in Dallas (remote) and I'd been supporting her through this time because she needed a sponsorship to stay in the U.S. After she landed a job, her attitude shifted and she broke it off with me I felt so betrayed even though I still loved her. I considered suicide at one point - just couldn't imagine living without this beautiful person.

My friends all supported me saying that I truly did deserve better than her and I firmly believe that too, but I still love her so much. It's been super painful these last few weeks knowing that the person I loved deeply was just leading me on and using me.

I graduated with a B.S. like her but have still not found a job in my field - I have almost zero motivation right now to find one because she's all I can really think about. I just feel so lost and not sure what to do. I miss her so much and imagine if we got back together, I'll have the proper motivation to better myself. 

To get her out of my mind, I've been talking to people on dating apps and even went out with a couple of them. But I look for qualities of her in everyone I meet.

,BreakUps,"Hey, I need some support and some advice from someone unbiased and able to see both sides. 

My (20F) boyfriend (22M) of 2.5 years broke up with me. Our relationship has been rocky for the past year but never enough for me to think about leaving him, but apparently it was bad enough for him. I suffer from severe depression and anxiety and fell into a dark hole of doing absolutely nothing. I quit my job, sat in bed all day, didn’t clean, didn’t shower or take care of myself didn’t do anything. Depression is killer. He says that’s the reason he left. He says he just couldn’t take it anymore and felt like I didn’t care about him or anything for the past year. Which is partially true. I didn’t care about anything except him. 

Now I was in the hole and I should’ve gotten help but I didn’t have his support. He doesn’t believe in depression. He thought I was faking it as an excuse to be lazy. I wasn’t. He didn’t handle it well. Instead of helping me to get help he put me down worse. He called me fat instead of getting me to eat right, he told me I smelled instead of getting me in the shower, he called me lazy, and useless and it just made it worse. I needed support and help and he wasn’t there to give it.

Now I understand not everyone can handle someone with depression. It’s a lot of work. But I feel like he could have at least tried a different approach. I’m not sure. 

I decided to get help on my own. I wanted to better myself and so I did. I went to the doctor and I got prescribed meds and referred to a counselor. The meds started to work about 2 weeks ago. I got up I showered I brushed my hair I cleaned my whole apartment I got a new job I got my shit together. I was feeling good. But he says I was too late. He came back from a weekend  away with friends and told me he cheated. He told me he was unhappy and he was going to be moving out in the next few weeks. I was too late fixing myself and I lost him. 

I did the whole crying, begging, apologizing thing. I wrote notes about my deepest feelings and I asked that while he was still living with me he pretend we were still together.(because it’s the only way I could cope with still seeing him everyday). He did that, but it was half assed obviously. He would kiss me with the side of his mouth, and he’d be texting that girl right in front of me. I’d tell him I love him when he left for work and he’d just mumble it obviously not wanting to say it. So I told him that if we were going to fake it I need his all so I can feel his love one more time. He said okay but that’s just going to make it worse. And it did. He kissed me that night he kissed me so passionately and lovingly that my heart stopped. My pain stopped. I don’t remember him ever kissing me like that before. He left to go to his friends house right after kissing me.

I didn’t talk to him all weekend until he came home on Monday. I asked him how his weekend went we talked and then I started crying and asking for him back again. Mistake I know. He said he doesn’t want me, I’m too late, and it’s over. He walked out the door after that. I texted him and told him to just give me a week to prove myself, he never responded. 

Yesterday I’m at work and I realize that I was acting crazy. I text him and ask if we could talk. He calls me and I tell him I’m sorry and I respect his decision to leave and blah blah really all bullshit just me trying to kiss ass to get him back. He tells me on the phone that he went to the house while I was working and packed up all his clothes and wasn’t coming back. 

I had been hiding how I truly felt about the situation because I felt like giving him all the love and affection would change his mind. So I sent him texts. I freaked out. I told him he’s leaving me for some girl he barely knows that he’s dropping everything and when he realizes what he’s loosing I won’t be here still. I freaked out. He was calm, he told me he was sorry and that it just wasn’t worth it anymore, he told me once we both figure ourselves out maybe we can talk about it. But he needs time alone. 

Now reading this you’re probably thinking that was a bad relationship anyways why do you want it back? Well because it wasn’t always bad, I have hella good memories about him. So many late nights and fun times and now it’s gone. I feel like the progress I was making with myself is all gone again. We’ve been through a lot together, we lived in hotel rooms, slept in tent, been hungry, broke, stressed beyond belief. But we grew together we got an apartment together just 2 months ago, something that we did on our own and we finally made it. 

Now I want him back, I wanna do all the things I wasn’t capable of doing back then. I wish I could go back and change. Idk what to do. I see a lot of people on here say no contact, but that mans my best friend my only support system and I don’t have that anymore. If I could just talk to him about anything I’d be a little happier than I am right now. Even if we just talked about the weather.  I wanna do no contact but I can’t stop typing out messages and then deleting them. Idk what to do, or if I can fix it. I mean we thought we’d be together forever, he even had my initials tattooed on his arm.

I guess in y’alls opinion do you think going no contact and giving him his space he will contact me again? Even just as friends? What should I do? What can I do? Anything helps just don’t tell me “he’s an ass and doesn’t know what he had” because that’s what everyone says and I know that he wasn’t the only problem. We both caused this. 

TLDR: my boyfriend broke up with me because of my depression and now I feel more depressed because he’s gone and I want him back.",t2_e0rrq,False,,0,False,First real break up. Tldr at the end..,[],r/BreakUps,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ih2q0m,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598490170.0,text,6,,,text,self.BreakUps,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, I need some support and some advice from someone unbiased and able to see both sides. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My (20F) boyfriend (22M) of 2.5 years broke up with me. Our relationship has been rocky for the past year but never enough for me to think about leaving him, but apparently it was bad enough for him. I suffer from severe depression and anxiety and fell into a dark hole of doing absolutely nothing. I quit my job, sat in bed all day, didn’t clean, didn’t shower or take care of myself didn’t do anything. Depression is killer. He says that’s the reason he left. He says he just couldn’t take it anymore and felt like I didn’t care about him or anything for the past year. Which is partially true. I didn’t care about anything except him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I was in the hole and I should’ve gotten help but I didn’t have his support. He doesn’t believe in depression. He thought I was faking it as an excuse to be lazy. I wasn’t. He didn’t handle it well. Instead of helping me to get help he put me down worse. He called me fat instead of getting me to eat right, he told me I smelled instead of getting me in the shower, he called me lazy, and useless and it just made it worse. I needed support and help and he wasn’t there to give it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I understand not everyone can handle someone with depression. It’s a lot of work. But I feel like he could have at least tried a different approach. I’m not sure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to get help on my own. I wanted to better myself and so I did. I went to the doctor and I got prescribed meds and referred to a counselor. The meds started to work about 2 weeks ago. I got up I showered I brushed my hair I cleaned my whole apartment I got a new job I got my shit together. I was feeling good. But he says I was too late. He came back from a weekend  away with friends and told me he cheated. He told me he was unhappy and he was going to be moving out in the next few weeks. I was too late fixing myself and I lost him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did the whole crying, begging, apologizing thing. I wrote notes about my deepest feelings and I asked that while he was still living with me he pretend we were still together.(because it’s the only way I could cope with still seeing him everyday). He did that, but it was half assed obviously. He would kiss me with the side of his mouth, and he’d be texting that girl right in front of me. I’d tell him I love him when he left for work and he’d just mumble it obviously not wanting to say it. So I told him that if we were going to fake it I need his all so I can feel his love one more time. He said okay but that’s just going to make it worse. And it did. He kissed me that night he kissed me so passionately and lovingly that my heart stopped. My pain stopped. I don’t remember him ever kissing me like that before. He left to go to his friends house right after kissing me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t talk to him all weekend until he came home on Monday. I asked him how his weekend went we talked and then I started crying and asking for him back again. Mistake I know. He said he doesn’t want me, I’m too late, and it’s over. He walked out the door after that. I texted him and told him to just give me a week to prove myself, he never responded. &lt;/p&gt;

,BreakUps,"I had a very confusing conversation with my ex last night. Our relationship lasted just over 3 years. In the beginning of August we were together but not “official.” We were working on things and things were honestly going really well. We went on a date then 3 days later he met a new girl through friends and they hooked up. We were making plans to see each other the following weekend, but I called it off when I found out. 

The next weekend he texted me asking if I was with my friends he saw out at a bar. He then was asking if I’m seeing anyone. Last weekend he texted me telling me he was in love with me and wants to talk. On Sunday he called me and we spoke on the phone for 40 minutes. He was talking to me outside of his house and the girl was sitting inside. On the call he told me he didn’t want to be with her because she’s not me. He likes how “fun” she is and that they have mutual friends but “no one compares to me.” 

Maybe a half hour after this conversation he facetimed me. The girl was no longer there and his friend who I haven’t seen in a while was telling me that my ex is in love with me and my ex was saying it as well. He asked to see me this week and I agreed. 

Last night he called me and essentially explained he’s choosing the new girl over me. He told me he meant everything he said on Sunday but a lot has happened in our relationship and he doesn’t know if he should cut off something new. I think he was looking for me to fight for him to be with me, but instead I just told him: I agree. I support you exploring someone new and want the best for you. 

He told me he wanted to continue talking to me. I explained I have every intention of being friendly if I see him out, but I will not be communicating with him any longer because it confuses me and I’m not trying to complicate things for either party. After we got off the call he texted me hearts and I didn’t answer.

,BreakUps,"Hiya! This is a long read. But anyways, I have these questions that’s been running through my mind for the longest time, and I want to hear your thoughts on my story.

First things first: I’m an Asian who was in a mostly online and long distance relationship with a military American for more than a year. The guy is approaching his thirties while I’m at my early twenties. We met online and have visited each other in both our countries once. 

A few months ago, he officially broke up with me for the second time (our first breakup was from last year; he tends to initiate a break whenever he feels overwhelmed).

As far as I can remember, he broke up with me because he was no longer happy dating me and he felt that we were both just leading each other on to nothing (Don’t agree with this since I’ve always been serious to him). He also mentioned that he didn’t have a plan for us &amp; was not onboard with the plans I had for us either.

Lastly, he shared that he also wasn’t well (very stressed out, his friends leaving, family probs, etc.). He believed in prioritizing himself for now since he felt that he wasn’t able to do that in his previous relationship.

He said that he was doing it for us because it feels fair, even if he felt that he might regret it. We had a smooth closure talk &amp; I think I was able to express my frustrations in a respectful way. I also told him I need to cut off contact for now in order to move on effectively from this, to which he agreed.

Now, I respect his decision. I really do believe that people have as much right to enter and leave our lives as they wish. Real love lets people go where they can grow, amirite?

As the days went by, I’ve been trying my best to grow from the experience. I allow myself to grieve and feel whatever emotions I was having, explore relevant thoughts that are worth pondering, &amp; try out new systems to improve my lifestyle &amp; values while surviving the pandemic.

Still, one of my biggest roadblocks that pushes me into a spiral is... why he did certain things that will confuse you. It’s a trigger that constantly plagues my insecurities &amp; holds me back from my actual growth.

I’ve been trying to fight back on entertaining these thoughts because sometimes I ask myself: are these questions really worth pursuing? Will gaining a new perspective on it actually help me be a better person?

Anyways, here’s the list:

1.) He never said he loved me &amp; had a “we’ll see where it goes” stance when I first asked him about the relationship.

When I asked if this was just a casual relationship, he threw a fit but didn’t actually answer the question, which made me think it’s a yes. However, I still had very deep feelings for him so I tried to accept it even if it’s not what I actually want.

Weird thing though is why show me to his friends and relatives? Why pay for stuff I didn’t ask him to lay  for, &amp; why send money whenever I asked even if I never forced him to it? And after all this, why did he say “I don’t know” when I asked him if he loved me?

2.) Surprisingly, our casual relationship lasted for more than a year. But why did he want me back the first time we broke up?

3.) When I visited him, he kept initiating a fight &amp; was constantly irritated with me half the time. I’ve tried talking about it &amp; making it up to him but it was never enough. Eventually, I asked him if he actually wants to break up, but why didn’t he say anything at the time?

In my experience, he has a hard time dealing with confrontation so I knew I won’t be successful even if I talked to him about it. Anyways, I just want to make sense of these things.

I feel that this will help me put certain issues to rest and give me a better idea on how to establish better boundaries in future relationships.

This is a long read. But anyways, I have these questions that’s been running through my mind for the longest time, and I want to hear your thoughts on my story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First things first: I’m an Asian who was in a mostly online and long distance relationship with a military American for more than a year. The guy is approaching his thirties while I’m at my early twenties. We met online and have visited each other in both our countries once. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, he officially broke up with me for the second time (our first breakup was from last year; he tends to initiate a break whenever he feels overwhelmed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I can remember, he broke up with me because he was no longer happy dating me and he felt that we were both just leading each other on to nothing (Don’t agree with this since I’ve always been serious to him). He also mentioned that he didn’t have a plan for us &amp;amp; was not onboard with the plans I had for us either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, he shared that he also wasn’t well (very stressed out, his friends leaving, family probs, etc.). He believed in prioritizing himself for now since he felt that he wasn’t able to do that in his previous relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said that he was doing it for us because it feels fair, even if he felt that he might regret it. We had a smooth closure talk &amp;amp; I think I was able to express my frustrations in a respectful way. I also told him I need to cut off contact for now in order to move on effectively from this, to which he agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I respect his decision. I really do believe that people have as much right to enter and leave our lives as they wish. Real love lets people go where they can grow, amirite?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the days went by, I’ve been trying my best to grow from the experience. I allow myself to grieve and feel whatever emotions I was having, explore relevant thoughts that are worth pondering, &amp;amp; try out new systems to improve my lifestyle &amp;amp; values while surviving the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, one of my biggest roadblocks that pushes me into a spiral is... why he did certain things that will confuse you. It’s a trigger that constantly plagues my insecurities &amp;amp; holds me back from my actual growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been trying to fight back on entertaining these thoughts because sometimes I ask myself: are these questions really worth pursuing? Will gaining a new perspective on it actually help me be a better person?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, here’s the list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.) He never said he loved me &amp;amp; had a “we’ll see where it goes” stance when I first asked him about the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I asked if this was just a casual relationship, he threw a fit but didn’t actually answer the question, which made me think it’s a yes. However, I still had very deep feelings for him so I tried to accept it even if it’s not what I actually want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weird thing though is why show me to his friends and relatives? Why pay for stuff I didn’t ask him to lay  for, &amp;amp; why send money whenever I asked even if I never forced him to it? And after all this, why did he say “I don’t know” when I asked him if he loved me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.) Surprisingly, our casual relationship lasted for more than a year. But why did he want me back the first time we broke up?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.) When I visited him, he kept initiating a fight &amp;amp; was constantly irritated with me half the time. I’ve tried talking about it &amp;amp; making it up to him but it was never enough. Eventually, I asked him if he actually wants to break up, but why didn’t he say anything at the time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience, he has a hard time dealing with confrontation so I knew I won’t be successful even if I talked to him about it. Anyways, I just want to make sense of these things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel that this will help me put certain issues to rest and give me a better idea on how to establish better boundaries in future relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

,BreakUps,"Long story short. Dated for 6 months. She seemed really into me to start with. Around 1 month ago I became anxious that I didn't know where the relationship was going (ie) couldn't read her.

1 week before breakup. Girlfriend was suddenly distant- less enthusiastic to see me and less cuddly. Also sat so I couldn't see her phone and took her phone into the bathroom occasionally.

Now the real evidence haha. She had a messenger message from a guy she had dated months ago saying ""how are you? x"" she had left the phone around me when it came.

I confronted her and she said that he had got back in touch but had no interest in him because she had dated him and found him to be weird. Was concerned but thought I'd start monitoring her chats.

She much more distracted by her phone than normal. And when we were going to bed the phone was buzzing and she joked it off saying ""the group chat must be busy tonight"".

Anyway...

A few nights later she tells me she went to the pub with some of her ""friends"" (non specific) which is unusual but not impossible as she does have friend circle I never really interacted with.

Then two days later she meets up with me and dumps me saying I was perfect for her but she just thought something was missing and she wants to remain friends.

I then accuse her of there being another guy and she denies it multiple times but insists she would like to be friends (see facebook etc). She said I added 2+2 and came up with 6. She denied being more secretive and she again confirmed the guy was arrogant and weird looking. I also contacted this guy and asked him and he said no definitely not but its not like he has to tell the truth.

So question was i cheated on before she broke up with me? I know it seems that way but being distant and guarded of her phone could also of been the fact she admitted she had been chatting to her sister about dumping me.

Also the guy that got back in touch doesn't seem to be on messenger when she is which would indicate they are talking.

I know it doesn't look good but admittedly I don't know whether she was cheating or just distant/ had checked out of the relationship.

Also she insists we should remain friends despite the fact I will find out if it is this guy and go mental haha.",t2_5fm3n0xq,False,,0,False,Did she cheat on me before breakup?,[],r/BreakUps,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ih1gmm,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,1598458094.0,,[],{},,True,,1598486232.0,text,6,,,text,self.BreakUps,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long story short. Dated for 6 months. She seemed really into me to start with. Around 1 month ago I became anxious that I didn&amp;#39;t know where the relationship was going (ie) couldn&amp;#39;t read her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 week before breakup. Girlfriend was suddenly distant- less enthusiastic to see me and less cuddly. Also sat so I couldn&amp;#39;t see her phone and took her phone into the bathroom occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the real evidence haha. She had a messenger message from a guy she had dated months ago saying &amp;quot;how are you? x&amp;quot; she had left the phone around me when it came.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I confronted her and she said that he had got back in touch but had no interest in him because she had dated him and found him to be weird. Was concerned but thought I&amp;#39;d start monitoring her chats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She much more distracted by her phone than normal. And when we were going to bed the phone was buzzing and she joked it off saying &amp;quot;the group chat must be busy tonight&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few nights later she tells me she went to the pub with some of her &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; (non specific) which is unusual but not impossible as she does have friend circle I never really interacted with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then two days later she meets up with me and dumps me saying I was perfect for her but she just thought something was missing and she wants to remain friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then accuse her of there being another guy and she denies it multiple times but insists she would like to be friends (see facebook etc). She said I added 2+2 and came up with 6. She denied being more secretive and she again confirmed the guy was arrogant and weird looking. I also contacted this guy and asked him and he said no definitely not but its not like he has to tell the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So question was i cheated on before she broke up with me? I know it seems that way but being distant and guarded of her phone could also of been the fact she admitted she had been chatting to her sister about dumping me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also the guy that got back in touch doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be on messenger when she is which would indicate they are talking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it doesn&amp;#39;t look good but admittedly I don&amp;#39;t know whether she was cheating or just distant/ had checked out of the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also she insists we should remain friends despite the fact I will find out if it is this guy and go mental haha.&lt;/p&gt;

,BreakUps,"She \[23F\] decided to end things with me \[25M\] exactly a month ago, and we quickly initiated no contact soon after. I'm slowly getting better but really would like some clear understanding on what went wrong.

We met through a mutual friend in 2018. At that point, we were both in school in states that were very far away from each other. But we connected and spoke nonstop for a good month before I ultimately told her I had feelings for her. Because she was visiting with family, we were able to go on a date where I lived. After her visit, I agreed to move out there to be with her, as she still had school and she really didn't want to try an LDR. 

I was actually in the middle of a career shift (post graduating) and decided to move, work, and go to school to work on my career. And for a good year, it worked out pretty well. We had our fights, mostly about what happens when I ultimately have to move back to continue my career (was not possible in her state) and stress that surrounded moving to be with her (stuck with a dead end job and terrible hours / away from all of my family and friends / full school workload / adjusting to a vastly different location). But we typically weathered the storm pretty well. Once she graduated, she decided to look for a job, which would mean either committing to where we already were or to where I would be in the future for my career. And ultimately, she decided to apply where she was. I was pretty damn upset and stated that when I did move, she would probably have to move or the relationship would be difficult to work out, as I felt I invested so much in the initial stages to build the foundation of the relationship. 

COVID hit and stress started to climb even more (wasn't able to fly out to go see family and was generally locked in). We still made time to see each other but she grew more and more distant. I confronted her about it and she suggested that I shouldn't be complaining about my job or what it entailed because I chose to move out there for her. She then sent me home and said she needed space to think. We decided to work on it, but over the course of 3 months time, she grew so distant that I only really heard from her every 2-3 hours, if that. It got to a point where I was so anxious I couldn't eat or sleep. So when I decided to confront her again, she told me that she had been emotionally checking out since that prior confrontation, and that she just felt that our interactions grew too bland for her. Ultimately, she decided that it was best that we go our separate ways, as we had issues that wouldn't be possible to solve.

That was a month ago, and we haven't spoken since. I have barely been getting sleep, barely been eating, but have started to pack my things to leave for home.

,BreakUps,"Not necessarily a break up as we never officially dated, but I'm still pretty sad nonetheless and am hoping to get some perspective additional perspective. 

I (23M) was talking to this girl (21F) I met online for quite a bit. We got really close primarily over Snapchat and spoke constantly.

Then at one point she flat out stopped responding entirely, not even opening my messages. Two weeks went by and I decided to just text her directly.

Respectfully, I asked if she was ok and if she doesn't want to talk anymore to just lmk. 

She answered back about an hour later, apologizing and eplaining how she had logged out of snap and hardly used her phone anymore. She said she loves speaking with me but she has been so depressed and just wants to run away from everything and everyone. 

I told her I understand and that she can tell me anything if she needed to just vent. She opened up about what was going on and it was some pretty heavy stuff. She had mentioned some of it prior to her ghosting so I saw how it all snowballed. 

She then said she would be deleting her snap and likely getting rid of her phone soon, and if we never speak again to remember that I'm one of the greatest people she had ever met. She explained how much I've made her laugh when she doesn't find anybody funny. And how much she hates men but I'm different and she's so soft with me.

I gave her my contact info and told her to stay in touch and reach out when things get better. She saved the message and said, ""I think I'm deleting this [Snapchat] now. I'm so sorry, thank you so much. You are an angel"". 

Then things took a turn. Later that night I saw she was on WhatsApp and sent a text to check up and let her know she's in my thoughts. Within a few short moments (literally like 30 seconds) she blocked my phone and Snapchat. She didn't delete her account, it still exists. 

It's one thing if she deleted her snap and got rid of her phone. It's another to be singled out and blocked. I don't know if anything she said is true anymore, and it has put a huge dent in my self-esteem.

&lt;p&gt;I (23M) was talking to this girl (21F) I met online for quite a bit. We got really close primarily over Snapchat and spoke constantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then at one point she flat out stopped responding entirely, not even opening my messages. Two weeks went by and I decided to just text her directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respectfully, I asked if she was ok and if she doesn&amp;#39;t want to talk anymore to just lmk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She answered back about an hour later, apologizing and eplaining how she had logged out of snap and hardly used her phone anymore. She said she loves speaking with me but she has been so depressed and just wants to run away from everything and everyone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told her I understand and that she can tell me anything if she needed to just vent. She opened up about what was going on and it was some pretty heavy stuff. She had mentioned some of it prior to her ghosting so I saw how it all snowballed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She then said she would be deleting her snap and likely getting rid of her phone soon, and if we never speak again to remember that I&amp;#39;m one of the greatest people she had ever met. She explained how much I&amp;#39;ve made her laugh when she doesn&amp;#39;t find anybody funny. And how much she hates men but I&amp;#39;m different and she&amp;#39;s so soft with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gave her my contact info and told her to stay in touch and reach out when things get better. She saved the message and said, &amp;quot;I think I&amp;#39;m deleting this [Snapchat] now. I&amp;#39;m so sorry, thank you so much. You are an angel&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then things took a turn. Later that night I saw she was on WhatsApp and sent a text to check up and let her know she&amp;#39;s in my thoughts. Within a few short moments (literally like 30 seconds) she blocked my phone and Snapchat. She didn&amp;#39;t delete her account, it still exists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s one thing if she deleted her snap and got rid of her phone. It&amp;#39;s another to be singled out and blocked. I don&amp;#39;t know if anything she said is true anymore, and it has put a huge dent in my self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just have such a hard time connecting how highly she spoke of me to getting blocked. I don&amp;#39;t think she&amp;#39;ll ever have the desire to unblock and reach back out and the idea of never speaking again is killing me. We were so close.

 We had known each other for a number of years but were never super close. We had tried to date 2 years earlier for them to mistreat me for an ex they had in another state, we parted pretty badly be ended up bumping into each other at a local restaurant and they apologized. Patching things up everything seemed smooth. Ended up hooking up a bunch, things are cool. They have a big substance abuse problem, they had asked me to be with them while under the influence, had asked them if that’s how they really felt when sober for them to say yes.

Over the course of the first three months they had been speaking deliberately inappropriate with tons of people and even that ex from two years ago. Countless arguments, lots of crying, emotions all over the place with that. After a point I would assume something came over them to at least stop all that, due to the pattern it was a tad hard to trust them without proof. The substance abuse gradually got worse to the point that bills would go unpaid, they would spend an entire paycheck of their vices, over all just really negative behavior. Being a victim of abuse and manipulation tactics it triggered something within in me to get EXTREMELY defensive and lash out without me really realizing it (not my proudest moments but have to own up to not being perfect) our relationship seemingly fizzled out. They weren’t super affectionate (they never truly were to begin with but they almost had no emotions ever now), they always though I was trying to fight with them when I just naturally have a pretty loud speaking voice, doing anything with them was almost like pulling teeth. 


How are expressed my grievances on many occasions since communication is important but it was almost the same conversation every time. They kinda got the hint but would stop after a week. While I would keep giving my all, loving them, taking care of them for the sake of doing it. Not knowing what else could be done. The substance-abuse issue popped up again as of recently, they came home extremely intoxicated and things went south fast. They claim to have wanted space, yet, took most of their important items when we had already been living together for that year (it was logical to thing what they said wasn’t true because of that) 
Now, there’s a strong possibility that I’m pregnant by this person and things are in the state it’s in. Was told that I was “too much”, which, I’ve been getting my entire life. I don’t bother anybody. I stand by the people I love and love as hard as I just for it feeling like the right thing to do. 

I miss them but I don’t miss how I was treated and how badly I have came out of character because of that mistreatment, but, I also like not being so extremely on edge all the time. Don’t have to worry about anyone fucking me over in are degree.

,BreakUps,"First, let me get clear on what neediness is and what it isn't, because I see a lot of misconceptions about it and because society distorted it's meaning.

Neediness is NOT wanting and desiring love, connection and intimacy. Neediness is when you can't function like a normal person whenever these needs are not being met by your partner. It is when you put others on a pedestal and view them as higher or more than you and when you use pick up techniques or memorize Pick up lines to get a girl/guy.

With this out of the way, let me list the keys to transcend neediness (they helped me transcend it many years ago):

- Make solitude your best friend.

You would be surprised if I told you how many people in this world (including your ex) are with people they don't actually like, let alone love, just because they can't be on their own.

Why can't they be on their own? Well, because they are afraid of the negative shit inside them. They fear the shame, the guilt and the negative energy that comes up when they are alone. They simply never learned to take responsibility for themselves and their life.

Thus, they escape themselves by jumping from relationship to relationship, hoping it will fix their problems. They never take time to heal because it seems to be too painful. And thus, they never find a partner they actually like and who is a match to them.

Btw, I don't intent to mock anyone, just to spread awareness. If you are one of these people, then I hope this post gives you some insight. You are still a good person that just needs some healing.

Since you are single right now, you are ahead of these people. I encourage you to embrace the solitude you experience right now. Sit with yourself and learn to accept yourself with loving kindness. Also meditate daily. Use this time to lay a solid foundation for yourself and to grow.

A man and a woman with lots of inner growth will always be a better long term partner than someone with wealth and good looks but zero growth.

- You are already complete.

Drop the idea of 'when I finally get the girl/the guy/my ex back, things will be great again' and 'you are the half that completes me'.

This is complete BS thats been instilled into our minds by disney movies and other media since childhood.

You are already the person you think you will be once your ex comes back or once you get your ideal partner. You are already whole and complete. You just need to allow yourself to feel this way right now.

- Cultivate an abundance mindset.

All neediness originates from a mindset of lack.
It is a mindset of beliefs that tell you 'there aren't enough partners for me, therefore I need to cling to this one person' and 'I am unworthy of this and that'.

Process and replace these beliefs with empowering beliefs that support the idea of abundance.

Replace it with 'among 8 billion people are more potential partners for me than I could ever be with in ten lifetimes' and 'love is an abundant and infinite source that flows through me' 'I am love, therefore I attract love' 'I am worthy of intimacy and respect'.

- How your ex views you is none of your business.

I found that breakups leave you with a feeling of deep shame and unworthiness because when we are needy, we tend to overestimate our ex partners and paint a picture of them in our minds that is not who they really are.

However, during neediness we also tend to embody the negative image our ex partners impose on us.

Know that this is NOT who you are and NOT who you have to be. You alone decide who you are and what direction your life goes. No one else. It doesnt matter what your ex believes about you, what you did or didnt do, just make sure you have a healthy self image.

If they cheated on you, know that they made this decision. It is not your fault, no matter how bad the relationship was. Neither does it mean you are a bad partner. It simply means your ex doesn't value monogamy much and prioritizes his or her own needs at the expense of their integrity.

Cheating is an act of neediness btw.

- Let go of resentment.

Resentment is the relationship killer number 1.

Because it keeps you stuck in neediness, puts your focus on everything wrong and doesnt allow for love to grow.

Instead of resenting your ex or current partner, accept them. Accept the Situation as it is. Resentment hurts you more than it hurts the one you resent.

So replace it with love for yourself instead. You do this by accepting, respecting and working on yourself.

,BreakUps,"Background info: I’m 22m girl was 21f, we met in sixth form in year 13 we sat next to each other but didn’t speak, I know weird lol. But beginning of may in lockdown she posted on her Instagram story and I replied with some backward sarcasm and we had a great conversation. So it’s all over FaceTime and phone calls (lockdown eh)

We started speaking on the phone, first call was 5 hours, great chem, Second was the same again didn’t realise, when you click time flies. When we FaceTimed each other for the first time she dropped her guard to me and told me stuff she went though and said she’s never told anybody this(not even her best friends or a close family member) I was really empathetic and made her feel good about herself and caring. 

Two weeks later or so I dropped mine, again she was very empathetic to me and cared and said the nicest things I’ve heard(which I haven’t told anyone either) something happens in my personal life at home whilst I’m stuck at my uni accom but still affected me. My emotionally vulnerability is exposed, I turned to her because of the trust and confinement we see in each other. She was there for me, also said ‘the way that you are with me and the way you treat me’ bringing me up and she’s getting upset too. Shows the feelings towards one another.

A week later I admit that I like her, we both admit we’re emotionally attached to each other. Admit it’s the empathy confinement trust and caring which what it was (it’s like 5-6 weeks by now) and I said I wanna progress into something serious with you and she said I didn’t wanna get my hopes up because I didn’t know you were on the same page. But now I can.

So yeah great June was fuckjng great. I used to say: you’re the most beautiful, I look at you and I just look at you’re heart and it takes over that’s what’s the most beautiful, this connection we’ve made it so natural but unnatural with how quick it was. But it’s real. I said I want to give her my heart I owe her it and I just wanna make her happy, I appreciate her, she’s worth a lot to me, I finally feel I’ve expressed my.Emotions freely (by the time we are opening up more about our pasts/secrets)

She used to say: I look at other guys and they just seem ugly but you seem the most beautiful, this connection I would be hurt so much if I was to ever let it go, I appreciate you in my life and I trust you, you make me so happy this is the happiest I’ve ever been, she started crying over FaceTime once too with the way I told her how I feel. She also said my dad is my solemate said I have the same qualities as her dad. Said I could meet your mum over FaceTime with the way I feel so close to you. I was attentive to her self love issues and other issues too. Spoke about having sex and sexual banter too. I trust you like no other human on this planet. 

So we met up in July after ease of lockdown, first thing we do is kiss. Spent all day just sitting down talking laughing joking around kissing. Lovely day. Then towards the end of it I told her I’m in love with her, she kisses me and whatever can’t stop, said to me ‘I want to give you the reassurance that there is that same feeling for you there really is, i just don’t wanna say it yet’. Beautiful 
4 days later she’s takes off the label of Bf and Gf and says it didn’t sink in- she has really bad self love issues and esteem btw. I was like we said this and we’ve waited a month for this. Can’t remember what she said, she said my feeling towards you haven’t changed nor will they ever. Great

3 days later from that ^^ she calls me in the night saying ‘I’m not good for you, you’re so much of a better person than me, I don’t deserve to be with you’ crying her eyes out, I uplift her by saying you’re amazing I appreciate you you’re worth so much to me and I fallen in love with an person. She broke my heart by Turning around to say, ‘but I don’t love you like that I love you like a friend’ - that broke my heart; I started crying said I’m sorry I’m not the right person for you- she turned round and said you are you really are the right person. After an hour or so she asked for space.

So 3 weeks later- we Spoke- she didn’t call me once, text me once, think about me once, whilst I was calling her, texting her, checking how she was. -that right there hurt. She didn’t care. We spoke she said I had such deep feelings for you. Ironic- ‘had’ indicating she dropped them ‘deep feelings’ how the fuck is that possible?? Either she never had them, lied or fucked someone else, btw last time she had sex was two years ago. She Also said if I lost this connection it would kill me you’re the most important person to me- how when you didn’t message me once in three weeks. She honestly destroyed my self esteem, from feeling I was appreciated worth and cared for to feeling like shit. She said I can’t be in a relationship but I need you in my life- I’m not no simp who’s gonna be a sideline or a backup.

When we FaceTimed each other for the first time she dropped her guard to me and told me stuff she went though and said she’s never told anybody this(not even her best friends or a close family member) I was really empathetic and made her feel good about herself and caring. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two weeks later or so I dropped mine, again she was very empathetic to me and cared and said the nicest things I’ve heard(which I haven’t told anyone either) something happens in my personal life at home whilst I’m stuck at my uni accom but still affected me. My emotionally vulnerability is exposed, I turned to her because of the trust and confinement we see in each other. She was there for me, also said ‘the way that you are with me and the way you treat me’ bringing me up and she’s getting upset too. Shows the feelings towards one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week later I admit that I like her, we both admit we’re emotionally attached to each other. Admit it’s the empathy confinement trust and caring which what it was (it’s like 5-6 weeks by now) and I said I wanna progress into something serious with you and she said I didn’t wanna get my hopes up because I didn’t know you were on the same page. But now I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah great June was fuckjng great. I used to say: you’re the most beautiful, I look at you and I just look at you’re heart and it takes over that’s what’s the most beautiful, this connection we’ve made it so natural but unnatural with how quick it was. But it’s real. I said I want to give her my heart I owe her it and I just wanna make her happy, I appreciate her, she’s worth a lot to me, I finally feel I’ve expressed my.Emotions freely (by the time we are opening up more about our pasts/secrets)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She used to say: I look at other guys and they just seem ugly but you seem the most beautiful, this connection I would be hurt so much if I was to ever let it go, I appreciate you in my life and I trust you, you make me so happy this is the happiest I’ve ever been, she started crying over FaceTime once too with the way I told her how I feel. She also said my dad is my solemate said I have the same qualities as her dad. Said I could meet your mum over FaceTime with the way I feel so close to you. I was attentive to her self love issues and other issues too. Spoke about having sex and sexual banter too. I trust you like no other human on this planet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we met up in July after ease of lockdown, first thing we do is kiss. Spent all day just sitting down talking laughing joking around kissing. Lovely day. Then towards the end of it I told her I’m in love with her, she kisses me and whatever can’t stop, said to me ‘I want to give you the reassurance that there is that same feeling for you there really is, i just don’t wanna say it yet’. Beautiful 
4 days later she’s takes off the label of Bf and Gf and says it didn’t sink in- she has really bad self love issues and esteem btw. I was like we said this and we’ve waited a month for this. Can’t remember what she said, she said my feeling towards you haven’t changed nor will they ever. Great&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 days later from that &lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt; she calls me in the night saying ‘I’m not good for you, you’re so much of a better person than me, I don’t deserve to be with you’ crying her eyes out, I uplift her by saying you’re amazing I appreciate you you’re worth so much to me and I fallen in love with an person. She broke my heart by Turning around to say, ‘but I don’t love you like that I love you like a friend’ - that broke my heart; I started crying said I’m sorry I’m not the right person for you- she turned round and said you are you really are the right person. After an hour or so she asked for space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So 3 weeks later- we Spoke- she didn’t call me once, text me once, think about me once, whilst I was calling her, texting her, checking how she was. -that right there hurt. She didn’t care. We spoke she said I had such deep feelings for you. Ironic- ‘had’ indicating she dropped them ‘deep feelings’ how the fuck is that possible?? Either she never had them, lied or fucked someone else, btw last time she had sex was two years ago. She Also said if I lost this connection it would kill me you’re the most important person to me- how when you didn’t message me once in three weeks. She honestly destroyed my self esteem, from feeling I was appreciated worth and cared for to feeling like shit. She said I can’t be in a relationship but I need you in my life- I’m not no simp who’s gonna be a sideline or a backup. I said I would have but yeah shit changes when a person you love destroys you with their lack of actions. Actions speak louder than words.&lt;/p&gt;

,BreakUps,"I’m (25M) slowly making progress following my agonising break up. I’m emotionally depleted and I, for the first time in my life, have reached out to psychological support. The effects of my break up have compounded due to quarantine. My psychologist has provisionally diagnosed me with Adjustment Disorder, and was on the verge of prescribing me medication, but due to being functional at work, is hoping i can pull through with behaviour and thought modification. 

Now, it is a long story so I’ll try keep it as short as I can, but I think it’s necessary to encapsulate the relationship. 

tl;dr; incredibly short (5months) intense relationship with F(22F), she wanted a break, but then quickly started chasing me again, distance causing a push pull dynamic and ultimately a breakup. She’s moved on to a rebound and then a relationship with someone else. 


Sorry about the length. 

When we met, the attraction and sparks were intense. We just got each other. We aligned in every aspect. We just couldn’t get enough of each other. 

This was my first proper relationship and so I was incredibly enthusiastic and excited. We were official in 3 weeks and soon after said our first I love yous. Now I was quite reserved which I told her about from the beginning, but she was frustrated at times that I wasn’t wearing my heart on my sleeve like she was. 

She told me quickly that she had never felt this way before, even after a 4 year relationship. That I was the best thing that had happened to her and that she felt so lucky. I treated her with respect, something that she told my friends, and hers too. Her friends and family were so sold on it as well, saying that she had found the one. 

She even jokingly mentioned marriage within the first two months. 

Felt like she pushed to meet with my and her parents quite quickly but I was so sold on her. 

There were a few things I brushed off, such as her constantly asking if we were ok, intense jealousy about my female friends (thinking I had ulterior motives), and retroactive jealousy if I ever had an ex (I didn’t). She was scared I was going to leave her even though I always told her I’d be there for her and that I loved her. 

I fell for her, hard. 

Things were going great, or so I thought. 4 months later, she mentioned that she felt like she couldn’t love me the way I loved her (even though she was incredibly clingy and loving at the start), and that she apparently pushed away people that she loved. I reassured her as best as I could. 

A week after not being able to see each other due to work commitments, she tearfully called me asking me if we were working as a couple. I noticed some distance but she told me it was due to her father, who was absent since her birth and was in a psychiatric facility. I was always there for her, but she seemingly didn’t want to open up over this time. 

She wanted a break - but she saw herself with me and wanted to marry me. I asked why and never got a concrete answer; I wasn’t there for her (always was) in relation to her father, I was overbearing and spoiled her too much, but she kept tossing between the two. 

I fought against the break, but no luck, she wanted it. So I caved and gave it to her. 

However, she was texting like everything was ok, and if anything was more switched on. I, regrettably, pulled away a bit too much. I let her initiate from here on. I was scared of pushing her away, but looking back it was as if I was intentionally ignoring her which goes against everything I stand for. 

She told me she loved me and missed me, and I told her I did too, and she responded with “do you though?”  

I could never get to see her due to her being busy. I wanted to talk but she brushed it off. So I pulled away a bit more. And we became dysfunctional. And she pulled away a bit more. 

I called and tried expressing that I felt like we were drifting apart and that she was worth it - but she told me she expected me to fight for it more. I wanted to but she asked me why didn’t I. I was at a loss. 

Even now she said she wanted to be with me, and marry me, but she was comfy by herself at the moment. A week later of trying to talk to her, she said I was suffocating her and that she wasn’t ready. And that was that. 

I loved her and feel like I fucked up incredibly. 

I found out she rebounded with someone she met during the break, and a month after the break up , was with another person and in a relationship.

As if everything I did didn’t matter. As if her words were empty. 

I’m struggling with my actions, it felt like I played push pull games myself. And I hate myself. 

My therapist mentioned it may have been BPD, but I hate to armchair diagnose. 

I gave her everything of me. I loved her unconditionally, and now I’m afraid to love again.",t2_4qdn96c3,False,,0,False,Am I in the wrong? Was there manipulation?,[],r/BreakUps,False,6,,0,,False,t3_igtu8z,False,dark,1.0,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598452311.0,text,6,,,text,self.BreakUps,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m (25M) slowly making progress following my agonising break up. I’m emotionally depleted and I, for the first time in my life, have reached out to psychological support. The effects of my break up have compounded due to quarantine. My psychologist has provisionally diagnosed me with Adjustment Disorder, and was on the verge of prescribing me medication, but due to being functional at work, is hoping i can pull through with behaviour and thought modification. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it is a long story so I’ll try keep it as short as I can, but I think it’s necessary to encapsulate the relationship. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tl;dr; incredibly short (5months) intense relationship with F(22F), she wanted a break, but then quickly started chasing me again, distance causing a push pull dynamic and ultimately a breakup. She’s moved on to a rebound and then a relationship with someone else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry about the length. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we met, the attraction and sparks were intense. We just got each other. We aligned in every aspect. We just couldn’t get enough of each other. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my first proper relationship and so I was incredibly enthusiastic and excited. We were official in 3 weeks and soon after said our first I love yous. Now I was quite reserved which I told her about from the beginning, but she was frustrated at times that I wasn’t wearing my heart on my sleeve like she was. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She told me quickly that she had never felt this way before, even after a 4 year relationship. That I was the best thing that had happened to her and that she felt so lucky. I treated her with respect, something that she told my friends, and hers too. Her friends and family were so sold on it as well, saying that she had found the one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She even jokingly mentioned marriage within the first two months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Felt like she pushed to meet with my and her parents quite quickly but I was so sold on her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a few things I brushed off, such as her constantly asking if we were ok, intense jealousy about my female friends (thinking I had ulterior motives), and retroactive jealousy if I ever had an ex (I didn’t). She was scared I was going to leave her even though I always told her I’d be there for her and that I loved her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fell for her, hard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things were going great, or so I thought. 4 months later, she mentioned that she felt like she couldn’t love me the way I loved her (even though she was incredibly clingy and loving at the start), and that she apparently pushed away people that she loved. I reassured her as best as I could. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week after not being able to see each other due to work commitments, she tearfully called me asking me if we were working as a couple. I noticed some distance but she told me it was due to her father, who was absent since her birth and was in a psychiatric facility. I was always there for her, but she seemingly didn’t want to open up over this time. &lt;/p&gt;

As our relationship was on stop for 3 month I took my first step meeting new people. I started with dating apps, got in contact with someone, became friends, later we ingnited feelings for eachother.


I had the urge to tell my ex, so she won't put too much hopes in getting back with me, as it really would be the best for both.

She blocked me, wished me a good life after I told her with full excitement in hopes it'll calm her, calm us. 

Later, about 2 months, we reconnected. She vented everything to me, telling me what bad of a person I am for having a girlfriend so fast ( 3 months after breakup), not to mention that she had multiple crushes which really threw me off during and after the relationship. She also told me about her suicide plans, which were a day before my birthday, apparently intended. She, her mind, was completely out of hand. Making her entire family hate and block me, putting me in a wrong light, with no hunch of what I initially intended for her.

,BreakUps,"Hello people of reddit.

So first things first: I'm M23 from europe and my ex-gf is F23. I'm not a native english speaker, so please forgive me if I make any mistakes. If you feel like it, you can correct them since I'm always eager to learn. 

So this is a long one, sorry for that but I don't really expect anyone to read it all and it's probably also going to be the most boring post you've ever seen on this sub but here goes:

Back in highschool there was this girl in my class whom I quickly developed a crush on. She is clearly one of the most intelligent, nice, caring, funny, educated and overall best people I have ever met. And on top of that she was truly beautiful. So yeah even then she was the woman of my dreams. She later told me that she actually fell for me too but we were both too shy to make a move. Sadly, we have had a huge argument after that and didn't speak to each other for 2 years when we had our A-levels (or rather our countries equivalent to them). 

After we finished all our exams I asked her to meet up because I actually kinda missed her and all the good talks we used to have deep into the nights. Our friendship has always been something very special and valuable to me. And what can I say? I fell for her again. Quickly. But this time I made the moves and we actually dated! 

Now a rather important detail is that I had kind of a harsh childhood and youth. My biological parents did not care for me, like, at all. I was told I was lying in my crib, crying all day, but nobody fed me, nobody changed my diapers and nobody showed me any kind of affection and one day I just gave up and didn't even cry anymore. Fortunately my biological aunt (whom I call my mum) and her then boyfriend took me into their care. But after they separated, we had to move a lot because of financial issues my mum had. So obviously I attended several elementary schools where I've always been the new guy which made subject to bullying. Furthermore my mum, as thankful as I am she took me, made lots of mistakes raising me because she has her own share of problems and traumas from her childhood. Following all that I never learned to love myself. Actually, I suffered from severe depression from grade 4 to grade 12 and had suicidal thoughts throughout my whole life. So it's pretty save to say that I didn't really have a happy life. Happy moments? Sure. Happy life? Not so much.

All that changed with that wonderful woman who I got so lucky with after the A-levels. After some trouble in the first months because we both had to learn how to be in a committed relationship first, she helped me overcome pretty much all of my demons. Where emotional emptiness might have dominated my mood that day or where sadness and/or self hatred would have induced negative thoughts, she was there and talked me through. I was in therapy for depression and OCD but alas, I didn't really get along with the therapist, so most therapy happened at her or my home, where we'd talk for hours on end and I'd practise to ignore my compulsive thoughts. Yes, I managed to cope with my OCD pretty well, even though it took a very long time, but I would still be that depressed piece of misery with OCD if it wasn't for her comfort, her support and her love. I was and still am so thankful for all that. For the very first time in my life, I felt truly loved for who I am. She taught me it's okay to make mistakes, she taught me I am indeed lovable and worthy of love! I felt things I didn't even know I could feel. I felt happy! I really don't know how else to say it. I felt so many positive things and I started to love my life, it was overwhelming. I was happy! I never wanted to let go of that feeling. She truly was the light in my life.

Of course there's hard moments and all that and she told me several times, what problems she sees in our relationship and I always tried to do better but it was never enough. After several weeks I always fell back to old habits. Of course she had problems, too. And I always tried to help her but I always felt so helpless. I knew I had to give back what I owed her and as I see it, I owe her happiness. But i never went far enough, I never could make her the happiest person on earth which is exactly what she deserves. But the worst thing is: I was lazy. I took her for granted after several years of being together. I hate my fucking dumbass for never taking it seriously enough. After all these times she told me what needs to change (reasonable reasons!) and after all the chances she gave me, I just fucked up. Badly. When she finally ended the relationship, I couldn't quite grasp it. I was so stressed out with work (online exams because corona) that I couldn't realise what just happened. Realisation came quick after I finished my exams and had time to think. 

To say I am devastated is an understatement. It's been 4 months now and all I can think of is her. She has the most beautiful eyes that look directly into your soul. Her smile could heal the worst pain. She is an angel, really. I remember our hours long talks about everything. I remember the little things like casually caressing each other and kisses on the forehead. I remember our chaotic humour that we shared and all the laughs we had or having candlelight dinners and watching movies together. I am so madly in love with that wonderful woman!

Now she's gone. And I can only blame myself. And that hurts like a motherfucker. All happiness seems to be drained from me, I'm a trainwreck of emotions. I cry myself to sleep and don't know exactly why. Is it because I miss her? Is it because I hate myself for being that arsehole who didn't take her seriously enough in the end? Is it because I know she could have been happier the whole time? I feel like I completely fucked up as a boyfriend. She says it's not my fault, it's just who I am: a bit of a lazy guy. But I swear I'd do literally ANYTHING to get her back. I know it's probably not healthy to be in need for someone else to feel valid but that's what it is. I doubt I'll ever be able to be happy with myself in that way. And at the moment I don't care a bit about that. I just want to feel loved.

,BreakUps,"My ex and I broke up in January. The grieving process has been a struggle for sure. I had to learn how to live alone for the first time in my life while mourning the end of my first long term serious relationship. I experienced intense feelings of sadness, anger, and anxiety through the rest of winter, all of spring, and most of this summer. All of that emotion overflowed into one big breakdown on Saturday, there are no words to describe how much pain I was in emotionally. 

I accepted the fact that I was scared to be single, I was scared to live alone, and ultimately I cannot control who stays in my life. If one day my friends decide to no longer associate with me, there’s nothing I can do about it because I can not control people or their actions/choices/words. All romantic relationships end, whether by breakup or by death, and that’s just life. One could say I was having a major existential crisis moment. Despite how painful Saturday turned out to be, I learned a lot about what I need when I’m not doing so well emotionally.

I cried a lot, sobbed even. I allowed myself to feel the full intensity of my emotions. But I also spoke to my counselor, and then I spoke to my friends. I shared my space and emotions with my brother and mom who were staying with me at the time instead of hiding in my room/napping to avoid the pain. After dropping my mom off at the airport on Sunday, I went grocery shopping, portioned out the food, went for a run, and took a bath. I visited the book store alone, something my ex and I did together all the time, and bought one book containing a variety of word puzzles along with a second book about bereavement. I discovered that keeping myself mentally stimulated with puzzles and reading is the easiest way to ground myself when I’m feeling anxious. Running, kayaking, spinning poi, yoga, and lifting allow the expression of energy that when left unused turns into anger and impatience. 

I woke up on Monday feeling as if a huge weight had been lifted off my chest. I could breathe easily for the first time since the new year. The sadness is still present as is the anxiety, but the intensity of both emotions has dropped immensely, and I am no longer angry or impatient. The amount of focus I am experiencing is exhilarating. Time seems to pass by at a slower pace and I no longer feel pressure from myself to rush my healing.

I have accepted that I don’t think I’ll ever be able to fully commit to moving in with, marrying, or having kids with someone. I want to acquire a long-lasting romantic monogamous relationship, but I know for sure I don’t want anything that will permanently/legally tie me to that person, and that’s okay. There’s someone out there who will want (or not want) the same things.

My (25m) ex and i split up 4 months ago.

Theyd talk till 3/4am and it seemed like they were always talking. She says he was just a friend. Apparently i didnt trust her and she left. I loved this girl and i feel as if she cheated on me.
After the split we talked on and off. Our friends and her parents all wanted us to work it out. She said she still loved me and wanted to work things out.

,BreakUps,"I posted here a while back about how my ex dumped me over text, saying something about us ""being better as friends."" and I have since gone no-contact for the last 4 weeks.

Anyway, while making breakfast, I get a text from him out of the blue asking for one of his belongings back since he needed it for work. I took a while to respond since I wasn't in the emotional capacity to respond calmly so I let it sit while I talked to some friends about them being the ones to deliver his stuff for me as I did not want to see him.

My ex then called me and I ignored it. I packed up his things and in the back of my mind.... I felt like I should get out of my house ASAP, because for some reason I felt like he would be the type of person to just come over. I left in a freaking hurry, scaring my mom and grandma, and went to our mutual friends to give him my ex's stuff to drop off for me. Then my mom texts me and says my EX CAME BY looking for his stuff.

I was flabbergasted that he would just go over without my permission and I can't believe he thought that was an okay thing to do. That's not okay, right?? I'm so glad I left when I did, I am not ready to see him face to face.

I just told him our mutual friend would make arrangements and also to not go to my house uninvited. And while I feel it was the right thing to set boundaries, I also feel bad. I don't want to burn bridges and I want things to be ok eventually even though I'm so angry with him. They're just mixed up emotions.

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, while making breakfast, I get a text from him out of the blue asking for one of his belongings back since he needed it for work. I took a while to respond since I wasn&amp;#39;t in the emotional capacity to respond calmly so I let it sit while I talked to some friends about them being the ones to deliver his stuff for me as I did not want to see him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My ex then called me and I ignored it. I packed up his things and in the back of my mind.... I felt like I should get out of my house ASAP, because for some reason I felt like he would be the type of person to just come over. I left in a freaking hurry, scaring my mom and grandma, and went to our mutual friends to give him my ex&amp;#39;s stuff to drop off for me. Then my mom texts me and says my EX CAME BY looking for his stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was flabbergasted that he would just go over without my permission and I can&amp;#39;t believe he thought that was an okay thing to do. That&amp;#39;s not okay, right?? I&amp;#39;m so glad I left when I did, I am not ready to see him face to face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just told him our mutual friend would make arrangements and also to not go to my house uninvited. And while I feel it was the right thing to set boundaries, I also feel bad. I don&amp;#39;t want to burn bridges and I want things to be ok eventually even though I&amp;#39;m so angry with him. They&amp;#39;re just mixed up emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

,BreakUps,"I've been on this sub for a while and I've talked to some neat people but I'm really struggling. I feel like my relationship ended with a lot of mixed signals and for some reasons outside of our control. I know I can't hold on to hope but the thought of thinking that it's really over is pretty devastating.

I'd been seeing my ex since late September 2019. We're both in our mid 20's. It took her about 4 months to formally commit to something serious, but I didn't mind much because from the very start she was genuine. Our relationship before March 2020 was pretty good and loads of fun. We clicked, we took care of each other emotionally, and we were into it. I was really thinking it would be something long term, and it seemed like she felt the same. It was her first relationship and she said sometimes it scared her how much she liked me, but I never really knew what to say to that so I don't remember how I replied. I knew that she had issues opening up to people, but because we clicked so well and I tried hard to hold space for her she wasn't like that with me.

Everything fell apart in March. Right before the US shut down we took a weekend trip together to a major city with some of her friends. I was pretty anxious the entire weekend because I'd been pretty mindful about covid, but I tried to ignore it because I didn't know anyone except for her. Apparently I didn't really do a good job of staying calm because everyone noticed I was on edge at certain points. In fairness to me I did end up running a fever at the end of the weekend, so that's why I was unwell emotionally. (No idea if I caught covid then but everyone else in my life was healthy so I doubt it.)

After that trip she did not see me the same, I think the honeymoon period had ended for her and she  suddenly realized I had mental health issues I wasn't working on. I was so focused on us having fun I was mostly ignoring my mild depression/anxiety/low self worth when we were together. I was NEVER emotionally abusive or manipulative, I was just hard on myself.

She spent the lock down with her family, and for her privacy I won't get into that but it wasn't good for her. I was in lock down with my roommate who I eventually didn't like living with. My ex asked to go on a break so I could work on my mental health, which I wasn't happy about because an endpoint wasn't defined...but I said yes because I couldn't flat out disagree with her. We spoke once a week on video chat and when that happened I know she still cared deeply for me and liked talking to me. I was worried she was using this break to compartmentalize our interactions because she had to hide our relationship from her family.

A few weeks in to this period (mid April) somebody in her life died. I didn't really know how to help, because we only spoke once a week I didn't know how to support her. We couldn't see eachother in person because of covid. Because her family couldn't know about us I couldn't just drop food off at her house or anything. A couple weeks after that I was starting to get frustrated with this break with no defined end; I was seeing a therapist, I was trying to make strides to fix my mental health issues, and I knew she really vibed with her therapist. I realized I wanted to be in a relationship where the person I'm seeing is cheering me on from the sidelines, supporting me as I bettered myself, because I want to do that for my partner as well. I wanted to be there for her as she struggled, but I felt shut out. So I voiced all that, I really was about to break up with her when in late April she relented. We started talking more, she told me I was special to her. I thought we were going to get back together.

At the very end of April we video chatted for an hour. Things were sort of normal, except I could tell she was a little sad. I thought it was the grief. At the end of that hour she broke up with me. I was blindsided, but I didn't fight her decision. I knew better than to beg for her to reconsider.

The last time we spoke was in late May. She said she missed me so much and she missed what we had, but she had to break it off with me because she couldn't handle being in a relationship, she had too much mental health stuff to work through. She asked for NC, I agreed I would not reach out to her unless it was an emergency.

Every day I wait for her to text me, I know it's bad but I miss her so much. In late July she accidentally 'reacted' to a message further back in our text history, which she immediately undid. Even if she doesn't want to get back together, I know she wasn't healing if she was reading our old texts. I can't talk to her though, which upsets me.

TL;DR: Because my ex broke up with me because of life circumstances and mental health issues and did NOT break up with me for the usual stuff (loss of love, fighting, cheating, etc.) I can't help but hold on to hope. Even more, she sent all these mixed signals before the breakup. I guess I need to accept that things are over, but even tho we broke up 4 months ago I'm crying as I type this. I miss her and I care about her. I want to reach out but I know I shouldn't. There are no emergencies in my life, just mild depression and inability to move on, so I need to wait for her to reach out to me.

We spoke once a week on video chat and when that happened I know she still cared deeply for me and liked talking to me. I was worried she was using this break to compartmentalize our interactions because she had to hide our relationship from her family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks in to this period (mid April) somebody in her life died. I didn&amp;#39;t really know how to help, because we only spoke once a week I didn&amp;#39;t know how to support her. We couldn&amp;#39;t see eachother in person because of covid. Because her family couldn&amp;#39;t know about us I couldn&amp;#39;t just drop food off at her house or anything. A couple weeks after that I was starting to get frustrated with this break with no defined end; I was seeing a therapist, I was trying to make strides to fix my mental health issues, and I knew she really vibed with her therapist. I realized I wanted to be in a relationship where the person I&amp;#39;m seeing is cheering me on from the sidelines, supporting me as I bettered myself, because I want to do that for my partner as well. I wanted to be there for her as she struggled, but I felt shut out. So I voiced all that, I really was about to break up with her when in late April she relented. We started talking more, she told me I was special to her. I thought we were going to get back together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the very end of April we video chatted for an hour. Things were sort of normal, except I could tell she was a little sad. I thought it was the grief. At the end of that hour she broke up with me. I was blindsided, but I didn&amp;#39;t fight her decision. I knew better than to beg for her to reconsider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time we spoke was in late May. She said she missed me so much and she missed what we had, but she had to break it off with me because she couldn&amp;#39;t handle being in a relationship, she had too much mental health stuff to work through. She asked for NC, I agreed I would not reach out to her unless it was an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day I wait for her to text me, I know it&amp;#39;s bad but I miss her so much. In late July she accidentally &amp;#39;reacted&amp;#39; to a message further back in our text history, which she immediately undid. Even if she doesn&amp;#39;t want to get back together, I know she wasn&amp;#39;t healing if she was reading our old texts. I can&amp;#39;t talk to her though, which upsets me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Because my ex broke up with me because of life circumstances and mental health issues and did NOT break up with me for the usual stuff (loss of love, fighting, cheating, etc.) I can&amp;#39;t help but hold on to hope. Even more, she sent all these mixed signals before the breakup. I guess I need to accept that things are over, but even tho we broke up 4 months ago I&amp;#39;m crying as I type this. I miss her and I care about her. I want to reach out but I know I shouldn&amp;#39;t. There are no emergencies in my life, just mild depression and inability to move on, so I need to wait for her to reach out to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this is long but I needed to get this off my heart. Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

,BreakUps,"Hi! I got dumped a little over a month ago and have been maintaining NC for almost a month now. I just wanted to share one of my recent realizations in hopes of it possibly helping anyone who’s also going through the same thing as me.

I realized that one of the most painful parts of my moving on process was letting go of the hope I’ve had for the relationship. It was so strong and it was there even when he was already telling me that he doesn’t want me anymore and he isn’t sure if he still loves me. Despite hearing all the reasons why he wanted to break up, I still bargained, proposed ways of how to make it work — all because of the hope I had in our relationship. Even after breaking up, a part of me still hoped he’d come back and change his mind and that things would magically be okay again.

The logical part of me knew that in order to move forward, I had to let go of this hope. To forcefully crush it and tell myself that it’s over and there’s no going back. It hurt like HELL.

After weeks of intense introspection and journaling, I found out something really interesting. Letting go of the hope had lead me to see all the doubts I’ve had from the very start. Perfectly legitimate doubts which I have actively downplayed and set aside because of the hope I had. I remember telling myself that maybe these doubts are just made up things in my head, or that they aren’t that big of a deal, or that they’re only temporary. I hoped things would change in the long run — maybe he’ll have more time for me in the future when he’s not too busy, maybe he’ll grow more affectionate, maybe I can eventually get him to try the things I like, maybe I’ll get used to this. That’s why I clung on to the relationship, I clung on to hope.

Turns out, I’ve been more in love with what the relationship COULD BE, rather than with what it ACTUALLY WAS. Which shouldn’t be the case! In an ideal relationship, you should be actively and presently happy and in love. It should have been one less thing to question in life.

Sigh. When you love, you hope for the best — that’s why I don’t beat myself up for having too much hope since I know it came from purely good intentions. I just wished I didn’t gaslight myself like that for too long. I should have listened more to the internal red flags I got. I should have trusted myself more.

Oh well, you live and you learn! This is definitely a lesson I’d take with me from now on. Not just in relationships, but in life in general!

Stay strong everyone!! I’m not 100% healed, but it definitely gets better ❤️ Love yourself and trust yourself more!

It’s been like three months since we decided to break up and move out of our place together. We’re still friends but we both know we just don’t belong together and that’s okay. That’s life. Recently I’ve finally started to feel a little better, like I could just go on casual meet ups with old friends and new ones, get some beers kick back and have good conversations. 
Instead I get sexually assaulted while I’m sleeping. 
I wake up to a “friend” who I had told earlier that night I didn’t feel comfortable doing anything sexual with him and that I just wanted to sleep. He tries multiple times to cuddle, kiss, and caress me. I tell him each time I don’t want to. The thing you may be wondering right now is, why didn’t you just get up and leave? It was already like 5 am, I was heavily intoxicated and was too far from my house to Uber back. 
This friend had been my support system, I told him how I was feeling everyday, how depressed and anxious I was, how I just was so excited to see him and finally catch up. And he decides to sexually violate me while I’m asleep. Waking up to someone trying to force his fingers into your vagina while you’re unconscious was the scariest feeling in my life.

,BreakUps,"I was there, every single step. To help you with your plans, your dreams, your ambitions. To listen to your frustrations, upsets, insecurities. I gave you my money, my things, my time, my effort, and my love. 

I did things to make you smile. I did things to help make your life easier. I did things so we would connect more. I did so much in the hopes that we would work through every obstacle, every hardship. I reached out, I asked, I did try. 

I believed in your promises. I believed in our future. I believed you loved me. 

Yet, even as you broke my heart, how could you say you love and care about me, when you could not/cannot hear my hurt? I have heard yours. I have sat with it. I have put away mine so you didn’t feel I was crowding you out. It was so hard to show you I understood, you always doubted I did. So I gave you the space, the silence. I would listen from dusk till dawn so you would felt heard. Even if it was grievances with me. 

But when I talked about the things you did that upset me, you would not give me the same. Instead, every negative word I said was poison and my existence a demon sent to tell you all your faults. Somehow I was wrong almost every time.  You would say things like, “I actually did do this, I did actually ask you that.” Yet, the same ghosts haunted me and I felt crazy. 

So I stopped. I thought maybe I wasn’t truly angry/frustrated/upset. Maybe I was all the things you said I am. When I was angry, you would be angry back, accusing me of talking too loud, of rambling, of being ridiculous. I started believing it and I began my path to change. 

Of course I had things to improve, we both did. Yet why is it I have changed so much and you have so little? 

Even when I stopped and started doing the things you told me, you were again upset. You wouldn’t let me just have my emotion. No. If I was having a bad day and I didn’t know why, I had to have been punishing you. Even though I followed the rules. Even though I tried to push through and find a smile. Somehow, me trying to stop having a bad day and be social, was actually me actively being passive aggressive and angry towards you. Even though I told you exactly what was going on - I was having a bad day and didn’t know why. I even gave reasons. You kept asking and I said, I really don’t know. You said okay. 

And now, I ask what I could’ve done better, and you say talk to you, I am bewildered. I thought I did. You told me I should say I don’t know if I don’t and I did. You told me I should tell you if I’m upset and I told you I was having a bad day. I spent so much time trying to break through the fog of a bad day to have a good time. But it’s on me to have talked more. Why didn’t you approach me? Why didn’t you comfort me like my friends tried to? Why was it on me to find you, sit you down, and explain myself on a day I happened to feel off seemingly without reason?

But that was it. The “last straw”. I was so confused. It didn’t matter that we had made such progress. It didn’t matter we had promised to do better. To sit down and talk about all the dirty, difficult things couples struggle with. To find a better way to work through difficulties and to understand each other more. You were too busy and I thought we’d finally have time to talk after everything settled down. No. This was it. This. Was. It. I don’t know what broke you. Or was it something else? Was it because I helped finish your project and you were done with me? Was I no longer useful? Did you just want the benefit of my friendship without commitment even though you broke my heart? 

Yet you still have the gall to get upset at me, for being angry after you told me you wanted to break up. I know I’m not perfect. I know I’m that moment I was reactionary. I apologized that I wasn’t able to hold it together after you said you wanted to still be friends, still do the things we’d talked about/ planned, and presumably have sex. But can you blame me? You want your cake and eat it too. 

My dear, silly ex, I did not feel loved. I did not feel special. The longer I sit here, the more these rose tinted glasses fade. I can’t tell myself it’s “just because you’re busy” and wallow in delusion anymore. You didn’t do dates, you rarely complimented me, you didn’t call me beautiful, you didn’t do flowers (until the end,  thanks for the mixed messages), you weren’t romantic, you barely talked to me despite my efforts to do better and make conversation. Everything was always on me. To make amends, to approach, to listen, to be empathetic, to change. 

You ask me to lean on you yet cover yourself in spines. How could I tell you my deepest thoughts if I fear your reaction? You cannot just say “I wish you would confide in me more,” and not create the space where I can. I can only force myself so much before I lose pieces of me. 

For you to be so so so upset with one day that doesn’t compare in the slightest to the things you’ve said you can’t have in your life, breaks me. Because it tells me that you just do not want my emotions despite what you say. It tells me you don’t acknowledge what I’ve done to become a better person and meet your needs. It shows your hypocrisy. It shows your lack of empathy for my experience. I don’t understand how you can throw my effort and progress away. I don’t know why you loathe or perhaps fear my emotions, but none of this is my mystery to solve. I will not live in constant rejection of myself. But of course, you’ll say you did all the “right” things and ignore every nuance, every flaw, every word you “forgot” I said. 

I should’ve listened when we got back together the first time. Your first question after I comforted you (you were sad and lonely), was asking about what I’d learned and what I would change. Not about how we’d make it better, not 
 your flaws, not how you contributed to everything that happened. It was about me. What I would do better. For you. 

You can delude yourself into thinking you’re amazing and did everything you could, but all I have to say is, “How do you tell a narcissist they’re a narcissist?” But you won’t listen so I won’t waste my breath. 

I refuse to be upset over you. I have pushed on for too long thinking there will be an end to this tunnel. That things were going to be better since you finished your projects. They weren’t. 

I refuse to give into insecurity because I know I’m enough. I am beautiful and absolutely worth it. I will not let you break me down any longer. 

I refuse to give into fear. Even though I’m scared of tomorrow, I will be brave and courageous. That anxiety is just the start of something new and exciting. 

I have given you enough of my time, enough of me. I won’t let you have control over my feelings and actions. I’ll take humility with my wrongs and grow, but not for you. I truly believe in my future and the beauty and awe it holds. There will be people who will stand by me even in times of hardship. Who will be empathetic and understanding.

,BreakUps,"I am well aware of how long this is, but I really wanted to create an image of what my long-term relationship was like before things ended, especially because things were so unconventional. I hope anyone going through a breakup can find some sort of comfort in my experience. 


I met my ex- we’ll call him Kieran- when I was 18. I was starting my freshman year of college. He was a third year biology student at the University of Bristol in England. I lived in Illinois and went to college there. We met on Tinder weirdly enough- he had been playing around with the passport feature and we matched. To spare you a whole lot of details, I visited him in England after six months of FaceTime calls and texting. It was everything we had hoped for it to be and more. 

Over the four years that followed, from 3,000 miles apart our lives slowly intertwined. We visited each other roughly every two months, as we were both students and given lots of breaks. I would live with his family and he would live with mine. I grew to adore his family; especially the way they treated me as their own when I stayed. My parents adored Kieran just as much; he was smart and bubbly and outgoing and charming as hell (the accent didn’t hurt). Our relationship was definitely work, but we were best friends. It felt like the imperfect perfect situation. 

As time went on we traveled a lot together, as it was his passion and I enjoyed it almost as much. The French Alps, Paris, Wales, Switzerland, Iceland, Sweden, Denmark. Home-base was England and it’s much easier to get around Europe when you’re already there. Kieran even talked me into doing a cycle tour one summer from northern Norway to Germany. I was apprehensive and underprepared but went along because I knew he would do it with or without me, and summer was our longest stretch of time to see each other. 

On our cycle tour and afterwards we argued. We argued a lot, actually, and became increasingly frustrated and bitter and stubborn because of it. Our good times were still incredible, but our bad patches were low. He feared commitment and didn’t like to discuss the future. I was overly-critical and externalized everything. He started a travel blog and began to prioritize that over seeing me, which I rapidly grew to resent. 

Last summer, we took one final trip together to Paris. Kieran’s father owned a successful TV production company and asked if we wanted to do a cameo on one of his docuseries there. We were flown out and decided to stay a week to really see the city. 

We fought the night before we left and consequentially slept in separate bedrooms. However, actually arriving in Paris was like a portal into a realm of happiness and peace. It was like something out of a movie. The weather was hot but sunny and we ate ice cream under the Eiffel Tower. We wine tasted and rode bikes through the narrow cobblestone streets. We stayed in a boutique hotel and bought French chocolate and ate it in bed at night when we were exhausted from walking around all day. We tried food we couldn’t pronounce and got lost on the metro. On our final evening we rode electric scooters through Paris’ empty streets at midnight and laughed and let the cool breeze envelop our faces.

It was August then. He broke up with me at the end of September. I was at home again going to college, fresh off my three-month stay in Europe. We had a fight over the phone; about what now I can’t even remember, which I find a lot of irony in now. I probably said some things I regretted, and so did he. 

I hung up the phone and sat in the middle of my bedroom floor crying harder than I had ever cried in my life. I cried so hard I felt nauseous and dizzy and like I couldn’t see straight. I managed to call my mom, who was at work. I told her that Kieran had broken up with me, and she rushed home immediately as moms do. In that moment it was clear to me how much parents really do care. It felt foreign but also comforting that for the first time in my adult life, I really needed my mom. 

I spent some time in denial, I spent some time trying to get Kieran back. We still communicated, but he hadn’t changed his mind. Even in early November I was still holding out hope that he would change his mind. He didn’t, and as that gradually sunk in I realized I had no choice but to move on. 

There still isn’t a word out there that I feel could accurately describe the sadness I felt about my relationship ending with Kieran. Grief, perhaps. I felt like not only he had died in a sense, but so had a life that I had grown to adore. I wasn’t just losing my partner, I was losing his family. His friends. His village. His friendship. I was losing adventure. I was losing England. I was being forced to close a chapter of my life that was arguably the best and most exciting. Being with Kieran made me feel alive. With him gone I felt helpless and like I had no say in the matter. I felt directionless. I felt lonely and unwanted. 

Everyone kept telling me the usual: things will get better. Time heals all wounds. It’s his loss. It was never sustainable anyway. You’ll find someone better. He did you a favor. 

The thing was, I didn’t want to find someone better. I wanted that life back; MY life back. And there was nothing I could do. I tried begging, I tried apologizing and taking responsibility for the entirety of our relationship’s flaws, which I now see retrospectively wasn’t fair either. Nothing worked; his mind was made up. So eventuality, I moved on. 

I joined Hinge and dated a few fuckboys, if I’m being honest. This temporarily made me feel better but worse when I realized they were indeed just that: fuckboys. I guess it’s called rebounding for a reason. 

But finally, I met someone new- we’ll call him Alex. He was a medical student at a university in Chicago. He was looking for a relationship. Alex was slightly introverted, which I wasn’t used to with Kieran, who was literally always the life of the party. Alex was soft-spoken and thoughtful and logical and kind. He was extremely handsome- the type of attractive where it almost hurts to look at the person for too long. He knew it too, but in a modest type of way. It took a long time for him to admit confidently that yes, he is aware that is he genetically blessed. Even so, he too had been in a long-term relationship before and had his heart broken. 

One day we were talking about being dumped, and Alex said something seemingly obvious that resonated with me:

“I think the reason why first loves so seldom are successful is because we haven’t learned from anything yet. First loves are often for experience and self-realization and figuring out what we like and don’t like. Where our standards lie, and whether or not the person we’re with is actually meeting them.” 

I thought about this, and my heart thawed a bit for Kieran. Sure, in many ways he did not treat me in the way that I deserved to be treated. But he was never awful to me, or intentionally mean, or abusive. He was never manipulative or untrustworthy or toxic. We were simply two people- two amazing friends that tried to be more for far too long. We weren’t right for each other because we wanted different things, not because Kieran was an awful human being. 

After realizing this, I finally understood what my mom meant when she had said that Kieran had done me a favor by breaking up with me. He set me free, in a sense. He allowed me to take everything that I had learned from our time together and funnel it into finding something better and more fulfilling for myself. I did just that with Alex, and nine months (and a quarantine) later we’re moving in together. 

Breaking up was the hardest thing I’ve ever been through. I wouldn’t wish it upon my worst enemy. I still think about that time in my life and cringe. It’s exceptionally hard to see any of the good when you’re in it, especially if you’re the one being dumped. But one day you will. I know everyone says that, but it is true- and I was the biggest skeptic. Hang in there. ❤️",t2_5o3cghai,False,,0,False,Boyfriend (m25) dumped me (f22) over the phone after 4 years together.

Home-base was England and it’s much easier to get around Europe when you’re already there. Kieran even talked me into doing a cycle tour one summer from northern Norway to Germany. I was apprehensive and underprepared but went along because I knew he would do it with or without me, and summer was our longest stretch of time to see each other. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our cycle tour and afterwards we argued. We argued a lot, actually, and became increasingly frustrated and bitter and stubborn because of it. Our good times were still incredible, but our bad patches were low. He feared commitment and didn’t like to discuss the future. I was overly-critical and externalized everything. He started a travel blog and began to prioritize that over seeing me, which I rapidly grew to resent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last summer, we took one final trip together to Paris. Kieran’s father owned a successful TV production company and asked if we wanted to do a cameo on one of his docuseries there. We were flown out and decided to stay a week to really see the city. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We fought the night before we left and consequentially slept in separate bedrooms. However, actually arriving in Paris was like a portal into a realm of happiness and peace. It was like something out of a movie. The weather was hot but sunny and we ate ice cream under the Eiffel Tower. We wine tasted and rode bikes through the narrow cobblestone streets. We stayed in a boutique hotel and bought French chocolate and ate it in bed at night when we were exhausted from walking around all day. We tried food we couldn’t pronounce and got lost on the metro. On our final evening we rode electric scooters through Paris’ empty streets at midnight and laughed and let the cool breeze envelop our faces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was August then. He broke up with me at the end of September. I was at home again going to college, fresh off my three-month stay in Europe. We had a fight over the phone; about what now I can’t even remember, which I find a lot of irony in now. I probably said some things I regretted, and so did he. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hung up the phone and sat in the middle of my bedroom floor crying harder than I had ever cried in my life. I cried so hard I felt nauseous and dizzy and like I couldn’t see straight. I managed to call my mom, who was at work. I told her that Kieran had broken up with me, and she rushed home immediately as moms do. In that moment it was clear to me how much parents really do care. It felt foreign but also comforting that for the first time in my adult life, I really needed my mom. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent some time in denial, I spent some time trying to get Kieran back. We still communicated, but he hadn’t changed his mind. Even in early November I was still holding out hope that he would change his mind. He didn’t, and as that gradually sunk in I realized I had no choice but to move on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There still isn’t a word out there that I feel could accurately describe the sadness I felt about my relationship ending with Kieran. Grief, perhaps. I felt like not only he had died in a sense, but so had a life that I had grown to adore. I wasn’t just losing my partner, I was losing his family. His friends. His village. His friendship. I was losing adventure. I was losing England. I was being forced to close a chapter of my life that was arguably the best and most exciting. Being with Kieran made me feel alive. With him gone I felt helpless and like I had no say in the matter. I felt directionless. I felt lonely and unwanted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone kept telling me the usual: things will get better. Time heals all wounds. It’s his loss. It was never sustainable anyway. You’ll find someone better. He did you a favor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing was, I didn’t want to find someone better. I wanted that life back; MY life back. And there was nothing I could do. I tried begging, I tried apologizing and taking responsibility for the entirety of our relationship’s flaws, which I now see retrospectively wasn’t fair either. Nothing worked; his mind was made up. So eventuality, I moved on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined Hinge and dated a few fuckboys, if I’m being honest. This temporarily made me feel better but worse when I realized they were indeed just that: fuckboys. I guess it’s called rebounding for a reason. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But finally, I met someone new- we’ll call him Alex. He was a medical student at a university in Chicago. He was looking for a relationship. Alex was slightly introverted, which I wasn’t used to with Kieran, who was literally always the life of the party. Alex was soft-spoken and thoughtful and logical and kind. He was extremely handsome- the type of attractive where it almost hurts to look at the person for too long. He knew it too, but in a modest type of way. It took a long time for him to admit confidently that yes, he is aware that is he genetically blessed. Even so, he too had been in a long-term relationship before and had his heart broken. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day we were talking about being dumped, and Alex said something seemingly obvious that resonated with me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think the reason why first loves so seldom are successful is because we haven’t learned from anything yet. First loves are often for experience and self-realization and figuring out what we like and don’t like. Where our standards lie, and whether or not the person we’re with is actually meeting them.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought about this, and my heart thawed a bit for Kieran. Sure, in many ways he did not treat me in the way that I deserved to be treated. But he was never awful to me, or intentionally mean, or abusive. He was never manipulative or untrustworthy or toxic. We were simply two people- two amazing friends that tried to be more for far too long. We weren’t right for each other because we wanted different things, not because Kieran was an awful human being. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After realizing this, I finally understood what my mom meant when she had said that Kieran had done me a favor by breaking up with me. He set me free, in a sense. He allowed me to take everything that I had learned from our time together and funnel it into finding something better and more fulfilling for myself. I did just that with Alex, and nine months (and a quarantine) later we’re moving in together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breaking up was the hardest thing I’ve ever been through. I wouldn’t wish it upon my worst enemy. I still think about that time in my life and cringe. It’s exceptionally hard to see any of the good when you’re in it, especially if you’re the one being dumped. But one day you will. I know everyone says that, but it is true- and I was the biggest skeptic. Hang in there. ❤️&lt;/p&gt;

,BreakUps,"Things between us came to a head when I realized I had nothing left to give him and he didn't want to give anything to me. I initiated the conversation but we never really established a break vs break up, we just knew we were separated. For the next couple months we maintained a decent friendship, with relationship conversations in between bc I kept wanting to discuss things - he did not. 

I found out near the end that even though I viewed this as time to recharge and regroup, he used it to chat with other girls and get a Tinder account (it was a brief thing but regardless, it happened). So, I asked him for his thoughts on our situation one last time. Nothing had changed for him so I let him know that it hurts me to be so close to him and can't be friends with him anymore (it hit me that he just wanted to have his cake and eat it too, by keeping me around but not having to commit). I left thinking I finally cut it off, &amp; I'd probably never speak to or see him again. Well, the night after he sends me a text, the night after a Snapchat, the night after a Snapchat video (also posted to his story so like it didn't count as much?). I ignored all 3 attempts and he seemed to get the point because he stopped for the next 4 nights. 

WELL, that's when I freaking ruined it. Two years ago, I made us a shared Google album of all the screenshots of cute messages from him that made me feel loved (my pathetic attempt at showing him that I wanted more of these little things but he never looked at it). That day, I was crying looking thru them bc I knew I'd eventually have to delete it but didn't know how or why. THAT'S WHEN I HIT A LIKE BUTTON AND IT NOTIFIED HIM - I didn't know you could chat on the thing. He immediately liked two photos in the album, I responded with sorry that was an accident and he said ""it's okay :)"". The exchange made me feel gross and it suddenly hit me that I DID need to delete the album. I told him why I kept these screenshots &amp; that I would never again put myself in a position where I have to remind myself that someone loves me, so I need to delete this album. 

Him: ""I think it's a nice album but if that's the reason then I understand"". I delete it immediately after bc wow um thanks for appreciating it AFTER WE'RE BROKEN UP. I thought it would end there but he sends me a fb message saying ""hi how are you doing""

Me: ""we're not friends right now so you're not in a position to ask me that"", ""I apologise for contacting you thru the album, I didn't know you could message and stuff on it""

Him: ""what do you mean we're not friends?""

Me: ""you made it clear that you need space and are unsure about me. I made it clear that I can't watch you demote me so easily to just a friend and fuck buddy"", ""we both need space to heal right now""

Him: ""okay, well, that makes sense. I guess I'll leave you alone for now, then.""

,BreakUps,"So This is gonna be a huge rant. I don't even know where to start....

 My first Bf in high school and smoked a lot of weed and drank a lot which I absolutely hated and I'd feel bad every time he did it which was very mentally tolling and very hard. At the time I thought no one else would like me so we kept dating. We had the same humor and got along okay but I literally knew from the beginning that the smoking and stuff would be why we'd break up. 2 months in, he cheated on my while drinking and I found out in such a bad way... My friends and I were all in PE in a circle talking to each other and the girl that made out with my bf told one person in the friend group then they'd both look at me, then that person would whisper to the next person, then they'd gasp or something and look at me, and it went all the way down the line until my best friend sitting next to me told me. It was bad I cried a lot that period, I had to not cry at school and that was the worst cause we had a couple classes together.  Basically I couldn't break up with him and we didn't talk for a while, he was the kind of guy that after he cheated he didn't talk to me or try to reach out cause he ""assumed that I hated him"". Literally everyone that knew told me to break up with him and i just couldn't, i didn't have it in me. So I kinda just started talking to him, anyways we ended up dating for a year and a half, had sex at like a year and a month and it became pretty much a physical relationship, that's basically all we'd do. I felt super guilty cause we weren't always safe and I was a 16 year old that knew sex was a sin so that was really just a toxic relationship. We had a lot of fun dates too it wasn't all bad. To sum it up, I told him repeatedly and months in advance that at the end of junior year, after summer we were gonna break up cause I wanted to focus on my senior year, I was in an advanced program and it was gonna be really hard and I didn't want all this drama. I broke up with him on our exact 1 1/2 anniversary cause it was a day before school started. It was a long time coming and he was just like ""okay"". I wasn't really sad cause the relationships been dead for a while, but even so we ended up being friends with benefits for like another 4-5 months, we wouldn't talk at school or anything id just meet him at his house. IK so healthy right? Well it was around Christmas time and i thought to myself oh my god im practically still dating this guy and I just never texted him if I could come over again. Let me remind u I was a good gf, caring, thoughtful, all of that. He just hurt me so much and so often the relationship just kinda died. Anyways thats just the origin story from 4 years ago so stick with me IK this is gonna be a novel and im sorry but its the only way people can understand whats goin on in my life rn. 

Okay if anyone is still reading this.... So 2 months after that break up... my senior prom is coming up and I kind of liked this guy (Get ready for some more drama folks we just scratched the surface) he was so cute and funny and shy, a lot of girls liked him but he was really insecure. I had a lot of classes with him because of this advanced program we had something like 49-60 people in the program so u had the same classes with everyone (classes were about 15-30 people) it really just varied on the subjects you chose. Anyways this guy, we knew each other for about 2 years and we had a good mutual friend in our classes and that friend told me to ask him out to prom, I even made a poster and everything. I was super nervous I had the poster under my desk and literally that same period the guy is super nervous and hes shaking and he tells me how he doesn't wanna go with anyone at prom and that im a really good friend. And then he goes and asks whats the poster under my desk, we have practically all the same hw assignments so I couldnt say it was hw. I dont remember what I said cause it was so long ago but I said it was basically nothing. That was a HUGE blow to my moral. I got pretty mad at the mutual friend for building me up to do all of that just so that id be rejected, I dont think it was his intention or maybe he didnt know, but he could have warned me not to say anything or bring the poster. I didn't say anything to the friend I think he even consoled me a bit.

SO I still dont have a date to the Prom..... I ask these 2 guy friends that I have from an outside of school club, where the girls and guys team usually practice next to each other and sometimes scrimmage together, we're from the same region so we'd even do some drills together. I know 1 of these two guys kinda liked me in the past and the other one (the one i kinda wanted to go with, completely separate from the 2 guys before that I talked about in the other paragraphs) was home schooled so I know that he didn't get to experience prom. So I asked them, and the guy that used to like me said nah, he'd rather do other things like ice skating. And the guy I wanted to go with said hell yeah! he was so down. That made me really happy and I kept saying like oh if u need a ride there I can take u and I guess I was just really afraid of being rejected again so I wanted to make sure there was nothing that would keep him from going....? Ik it sounds super clingy when I type it out :P So Prom was still a couple of months away, its now February and he said that he really wanted to get to know me better and we talked until 4 in the morning, super cute, I was like awww hes nothing like my ex, we really wants to know ME. So he was scared of asking me out because of his parents and how they didn't really let his siblings date until they got over so we talked about it a lot and I guess at one point we said hed ask me out at prom. So yes this is the guy that im currently extremely heart broken over just so you know. So I didn't realize it too much at the time but he did tell me he never had a girl friend before and I made all the first steps like I held his hand first, he kissed me first but only after i was dropping him off and it took him 30 mins to get the courage to do it (idk it could have been just more and more pressure building up from him knowing that I wanted to kiss him but I wasnt like u have to kiss me rn, i didnt ask or anything, i didnt intentionally pressure him). At this time I was always scared that I didn't really like him and he was just a rebound but i started liking him after a few weeks. anyways I kept asking if we were moving too fast and he kept saying no just go at your own pace. HO boy we ended up having sex at 2 months that was crazy fast for us, both of us weren't really ready it just happened. We were both terrified that night cause we weren't safe being dumb teens. And he was shaking later at home and I was so scared, had to buy the plan B a few times in this relationship just so u know. So thats how we started. At first he was really like I dont wanna say a push over but hed say yes to everything I wanted to do, go on walks, go to the park, beach, all of that. and it was soooo fun, id always ask him what he wanted to do and hed say idk whatever u want. Sometimes id keep insisting on doing what he wanted but i dont think hed really say anything. So some time in our relationship maybe like 6 months, we already said i love u and all that. We ended up switching roles, id do whatever he wanted to do. We'd always hang out with his friends and I was controlling when I wasn't with him or when his best friend who i did not like would take him to parties and stuff cause I was still traumatized from my ex, i didn't want him to cheat on me. I made it clear that I didn't want someone that smoked or drank. he said he didn't do that stuff. okay i'm gonna fast forward to last summer, we've been dating for over a year we were really in love but wed always get into little fights like we'd irritate each other and id get mad cause he doesn't know how to deal with my jealousy or anything wrong cause i've been teaching him how to be a boyfriend up to this point which was really hard for me cause its really hard for me to open up to people and talk about my feelings.

,BreakUps,"It really sucks that when there is a break up, you lose not only your lover, but your comrade and friend. In most situations, in my experiences, my partner had become my best friend.

I guess I just really wish that when there was a break up,  even if the romantic relationship is irreparable, the core friendship could still exist. I suppose some people have that ability, maybe im just not as evolved as other people. Or maybe my relationships haven't been as evolved as other peoples. It seems as though every breakup I've ever had has ultimately resulted in the loss of the friendship as well.

I'm not over here mad or crying over my most recent ex or anything. But I do miss their conversations, viewpoints, and general presence in my life. I know they are probably with someone new, and while that stings my heart, I do want them to be happy. I just think it really sucks how breakups work out. I wish things didn't work out that way, but it seems to be a pattern.

&lt;p&gt;I guess I just really wish that when there was a break up,  even if the romantic relationship is irreparable, the core friendship could still exist. I suppose some people have that ability, maybe im just not as evolved as other people. Or maybe my relationships haven&amp;#39;t been as evolved as other peoples. It seems as though every breakup I&amp;#39;ve ever had has ultimately resulted in the loss of the friendship as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not over here mad or crying over my most recent ex or anything. But I do miss their conversations, viewpoints, and general presence in my life. I know they are probably with someone new, and while that stings my heart, I do want them to be happy. I just think it really sucks how breakups work out.

,BreakUps,"Me and the guy I was engaged to had been together almost 3 years. We had no plans to get married yet as we wanted to save towards a mortgage but we was living together and had been for the last 8 months. 

As far as I was aware everything was fine with us, we were talking about the future and where we wanted to buy our forever home a few days ago. We even got gym memberships (his suggestion) at the local gym. We'd been laughing and not argued or done anything to trigger it. 

But he got home from work yesterday and the first thing he did was sit down and break up with me and tell me he can't be in the relationship. I was so in shock cuz it was so out the blue. I mean he'd told me the night before he wanted to go the gym together when he got home but instead he broke my heart. 

His gave me a ton of reasons why he did it now, here's some reasons:

. He wants to be able to support his dad more  (I never had a problem with this and wanted to help his dad to and he knew that)

. He said we argue to much (I personally don't think we argue to much, I admit I've had some emotional problems and outbursts but not at him..my mom died in May so I've been all over the place emotionally since)

. He misses being single and having the thrill of going out and hooking up.with randomer girls and chatting with his friends

. He has his own problems but he doesn't know what these are he just doesn't think he should be in a relationship

. His not over his mom's death 

. He loves me but not enough to stay with me. Then he doesn't love me then he loves me again. (It's all confusing)

. And the last big one was my mental health was to much for him and he can't handle my outbursts. That one hurt a lot cuz he always knew I have depression and anxiety (I was in supported living before we met for depression and help.with my autism) and I can't control when my bad times happen, it's been bad for a while but for obvious reasons it's been terrible since my mom died in May.

He said he was gonna move out but I spoke to him (in a emotional state) and asked him to not throw everything away but now I'm even more confused cuz he said he'll stay but he doesn't want to get back together and wants us to be room mates (we have a two bedroom flat) and split bills rent ect.

And he said he'll see if anything happens with me eventually but he wants to be casual and just see other girls. 

I'm just so confused cuz in the space of 24 hours he want from saying I love you and laughing and planning stuff to us being roommates. I don't know if I should of asked him to not stay here but I was worried how is afford the flat to on my own with all the bills. Plus all his stuff is here and the flats in both our names

He seems perfectly fine like his adjusted already and no times passed at all. He was playing video games saying that I'm single now if anyone wants to talk to me. It made me cringe when I heard him say that. Me on the other hand I'm confused and I can't stop crying. It's all just a mess. I've been trying to avoid him and let him do his own thing as if I wasn't here, in the sense like I haven't cooked his dinner cuz normally I do dinner for the two of us.

Everyone whose heard we split is suprised cuz it was so sudden and out of the blue so I know it wasn't just me who thought so. I'm not dealing with it well. I feel like he thinks he can just go off and do his own thing and come back when his ready but by him breaking up with me like that has ruined my trust in him that he won't do anything to hurt me cuz all his ever said is he'll always love me and wants to be with me forever. I don't even know if I'd be able to go back to normal if I wanted to cuz the doubt and worry would be in my head he'd randomly do it again.

,BreakUps,"I dated a girl four years ago and she was probably the love of my life. Unfortunately, I was young and dumb at the time and let her get away and we haven't talked since. At the time, I was so angry at her for being unsatisfied with me that I walked away and never looked back. She did the same shortly after. And while I am sure she doesn't think about me perhaps at all, I think of her all the time. It sucks. I don't exactly want to be back with her and cognitively miss her throughout my daily life, but I have dreams of bumping into her and it all being okay and it sucks waking up after that. 

I've managed to get over it mostly by just doing me and bettering myself, but it feels like everything I do, she's one step ahead. We both got the same prestigious internship right after each other, we both got into great law schools, and I feel like the two of us are essentially on a very similar path that will always have me comparing myself to her. And I'm bummed right now because she def had a better time at law school than I did. I can't help every once and a while seeing her facebook page to see what she's up to and feeling either triumphant or devastated depending on what she's doing. I know the obvious answer is to just stop paying attention to her, but at this stage that's like telling an alcoholic to just stop drinking. I can't just stop cold turkey at this point. I'd appreciate some help. 

We've both moved on romantically, but I can't escape this feeling of competition. To be honest though, I probably only don't care about her romantic life because I know I'm ""winning"" in that area.

,BreakUps,"Sorry if this is long, I just feel better when I let things out. 

I got dumped again. This time it hurts so much worse than my other relationship. He was my second serious boyfriend. I just turned 27 and he’s almost 26. We were together for almost a year and a half. We just moved in together in July. We talked about kids, marriage, the rest of our life together. My birthday was last Thursday and he bought me a card and wrote me a beautiful note explaining how much he loves me and how happy he gets waking up next to me and how glad he is to have met me blah blah blah.
 
A little back story. He moved to my city because he was getting into trouble with drugs and alcohol in his old city. He already had one dwi under his belt and was still drinking too much. We met and the relationship moved fast. Really fast. I’ve never felt this way about anyone before, not even my ex who I dated for over 5 years. I helped him through a lot. I bought him a bed when he was sleeping on the floor, I went to his court dates, I helped him find a job and helped him with money, I was patient with him when he got too drunk. The list goes on and on. I know I was so good to him. I gave him my whole heart and more but honestly, I always felt like the relationship was unbalanced. 

5 months into our relationship, after celebrating at a bar for my bday, I find many messages he sent to several girls on Facebook and Instagram while he was drunk downstairs. One of the messages he went into a lot of detail about how he wishes he could have gotten to know her better and how good of a person she was. She messaged him back saying how sweet he is and I couldn’t really bring myself to read the rest. The other messages he sent were telling girls he found them attractive and if he could take them out. Most of them didn’t respond. We ended up staying together after this under the condition that he have no social media for a while and because he convinced me that he only did it because he was super drunk. He even said he used to do that before me and he hated it and always regretted it in the morning. 

So he deletes all social media and tells me he’ll earn my trust back and that he loves me so much. He said he never cared for social media anyways so it’s not even a big deal. Fast forward to December, we’ve fought a lot still because of his drinking problem. The day we are supposed to go out of town for his sisters bday, I get a call saying he’s in jail for another dwi. This obviously causes even more strain in our relationship but I love him enough to get through it. 

He’s been sober since December and honestly him not drinking changed our relationship for the better. We still fought like normal couples and I still have trust issues but they were getting better. He ends up staying with me and my parents until we can get our own place. He never thanked them for taking him in.

Recently, he’s been talking to an old group of friends of his from high school on a group chat. He recently told me they were telling him to get a Snapchat and I asked him if he wanted one and he said no. No mention of it again until our fight last night. He also gets asked a lot by guys at work to go grab a drink even though they know he doesn’t drink anymore. 

He always told me that family is the only thing that matters and that it’s not a big deal to have friends and I always told him he should have friends because it’s healthy. Our fight last night ended with him basically telling me he feels like he can’t tell me things and that I’ll never trust him to hang out with people (even though I do and he has) and that he doesn’t want to keep hurting me. He said that he feels like what he did last year messed everything up. I asked him why we didn’t just break up when it happened and he said he didn’t know. I asked him why he moved in with me if he’s been feeling this way and again claimed he doesn’t know. 

I could tell he wasn’t happy about breaking up but it was obvious he made up his mind last night. I feel like he feels resentment towards me for not being able to go to bars or have social media even though he agreed to these things and promised he was fine with it. I feel like he wants to just go back to single life because he’s realizing relationships are hard work. I could be wrong though. He never really talked to me about this stuff, he just kind of blindsided me. His work also stresses him out bad and he works 6-7 days a week, 12 hour shifts. It’s exhausting work and I know he’s always tired.

My sister and my good friend never trusted him. My sister always said he was using me and I would always defend him. Now I feel foolish because I honestly think he did. I’m not sure if there was even any real love. 

I still have to go get all my stuff from our apartment. All the bills are set up to my account on autopay because he was too forgetful to handle all that. I’m a mess. I feel so broken. I still don’t even know why we broke up. He messaged me twice already saying he’s sorry he put me through this. I haven’t responded. Why bother?

,BreakUps,"I know how fucking strong this feeling inside is right now. This feeling that you need them, because without them you are not worthy of love and affection anymore. Fuck. They knew everything about you and still decided to throw you away like you were nothing. How could you be good enough, right? Fucking wrong.

You need to stop telling yourself that you need them to feel good about you again. You can still want them. But try to change what you tell yourself about yourself.

You don‘t need them and you don’t need anyone to feel good about yourself. Think about it. What you are missing so painfully right now is their validation. Them telling and showing you that you are good, that you are attractive, that you are a catch, that you have value as a partner, fuck, even as a human being.

But all those things they validated were there before they fell in love with you. They were what made them fall in love with you. They didn‘t make you a valuable person, they just saw the value you already possessed.

It‘s time that you start to see this value yourself. Without anyone validating that you are in fact good enough. Because you fucking are. You were before you met them and you are now, right now while you are reading those words.

You are who attracted them in the first place. You are who they couldn’t take their eyes from. Who they thought about constantly and who they were nervous about when thinking about if you like them too or when going for the first kiss. This was all you. Not them. They just validated something you probably did not see in yourself but wanted to.

Start seeing it yourself.

If they don‘t value you enough to fight for you, then fuck them. You have to much value to fight for someone who wouldn’t do the same for you.

I know how painful it is to even think about letting them go, to think about losing hope in them coming running back telling you how much they regret ever losing you. You may not be ready yet to let go of them, and that‘s absolutely okay, but please try to let go of basing your value and self-worth on their validation.

,BreakUps,"A letter to my ex..

It's been really hard, knowing that you could possibly be with someone that you met at the gym. I could be wrong, but you're single so you can be with anyone you want now. But it hurts. Seeing you be with somebody else, when that person could've been me. I gave you everything with all my heart, but you gave up on me, after just a year together.. you broke up with me over some dumb argument but saying it’s not because of that.. and saying you need space: I may blow up over little things but you reacted weirdly when I brought up that person you went to go gym with, to only find out that person showed up at your place a week later after we broke up.. You didn't even try these last couple months like you promised me you would to fight for us and me. You just wanted that spark like how things were in the beginning, but that's so superficial. You wanted to sleep around.. But I never would think that at your age, being 30 years old, and wanting that would be a thing. I think you would've grown up by now.. We stayed together during the worst of times and yet we made it thru. What happened? After I declined your invite to take me out for a bday dinner, you just blocked me on social media. Not even a proper word of goodbye to me. Are you mad at me? Do you ever think of me? Was I rude by saying that I thought you were someone special, but you weren't these last couple months?

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been really hard, knowing that you could possibly be with someone that you met at the gym. I could be wrong, but you&amp;#39;re single so you can be with anyone you want now. But it hurts. Seeing you be with somebody else, when that person could&amp;#39;ve been me. I gave you everything with all my heart, but you gave up on me, after just a year together.. you broke up with me over some dumb argument but saying it’s not because of that.. and saying you need space: I may blow up over little things but you reacted weirdly when I brought up that person you went to go gym with, to only find out that person showed up at your place a week later after we broke up.. You didn&amp;#39;t even try these last couple months like you promised me you would to fight for us and me. You just wanted that spark like how things were in the beginning, but that&amp;#39;s so superficial. You wanted to sleep around.. But I never would think that at your age, being 30 years old, and wanting that would be a thing. I think you would&amp;#39;ve grown up by now.. We stayed together during the worst of times and yet we made it thru. What happened? After I declined your invite to take me out for a bday dinner, you just blocked me on social media. Not even a proper word of goodbye to me. Are you mad at me? Do you ever think of me? Was I rude by saying that I thought you were someone special, but you weren&amp;#39;t these last couple months? We&amp;#39;ve had our fair share of really happy moments together. Going through my phone and looking at our happy pictures together, and our old polaroids. I found it so hard to get rid of.

,BreakUps,"I met a boy mid-June 2020 and we really clicked. We talked on the phone every single night, saw each other five times a week, went on a bunch of trips, new experiences, and really got to know each other. He told me that he was moving to a new apartment and invited me to live with him. 

I always had a gut feeling about his ex, because he would make every excuse (i.e., mutual friends) to not cut her out of his life. He told me they were ""friends"". Plus, he had feelings for her a month prior to meeting me, and moved to a condo next to her. He broke up with her in June 2019 because she was suicidal so he felt that she needed to work on her issues on her own (they dated for 1.5 years at that point). He had a rebound from August 2019 to Jan 2020, he dumped his rebound for his ex. He casually saw his ex from Jan 2020 to March 2020; she cut things off and he still wanted her. Although they were no longer dating in May, he was willing to take a leap and lease a condo next to her because he was hoping they would get back together. She was never interested in getting back together with him, until he posted a photo of him and I on his Instagram. She started messaging him and his friends weekly after that, and it made me very insecure and doubtful. He repeatedly told me that I had nothing to worry about, and he wouldn't go back because he did once and it didn't work out. I couldn’t trust him because I’ve been cheated on and hurt badly; he knew all of this and told me that he would be patient and wouldn’t leave, etc. 

Anyway, a week before I was supposed to move in with him, he uninvited me to live with him and said we should take a step back. I tried to respect his choice but it was very difficult because it hurt, a lot. This person I was planning a future with, out of the blue, uninvites me to live with them. I was taken aback. I felt stupid and my friends were confused. He thought we should try to rebuild our relationship because of my trust issues and doubts, and he didn’t feel like he was ready to continue taking leaps with me.

Less than 24 hours after he dumped me, he removed all photos of us off of social media. I think the breakup was something he has had in mind for a while?

It has been a week since he had dumped me and he is officially back together with his ex-GF. She had posted a bunch about them together on social media to rub it in my face. I feel so stupid but relieved at the same time. How insecure does she need to be to feel the need to rub him in my face when we were barely together for two months, and she knew him for over 2.5 years? 

I’ve never lived on my own before and dating him helped me take the plunge. After he uninvited me to live with him, I got my own place to prove to myself that I don’t need someone. Anyway, I spent a lot of money getting a condo in a nice building, parking for my car, etc. He dumped me barely three days after my lease began. I’m not sure how I should proceed? I feel like I’ve been thrown into the deep end, and any advice would be greatly appreciated. Finances aren't an issue but I am emotionally destroyed, to be honest. Thank you in advance.

How he dumped me:

The night before he dumped me, he told me that he was happy with me, loves me, and had no plans of breaking up. He dumped me less than 9 hours after he told me that...?

We met at a park that was about five minutes from my condo (he lives two minutes from me). We talked and he said that he still loves me but did not think the relationship was healthy; it was exhausting, and my constant doubts were only getting worse. Our relationship was not getting any better. He said he wanted to end things before they got worse because he believes they will. He starts school in a week and a half, and he won’t have the time or energy to constantly reassure me and his schedule will be packed. Told me our relationship was one of the most meaningful he had ever had and how much he will miss me.

,BreakUps,"My breakup was 7 month ago. Since then, the only thing i wanted (in a romanic context) was my ex. I should mention that i don't really like a lot of people, let alone meeting new people and smaltalk. Ugh. I have been single for 3 years before i met my ex.

You might be able to tell that i did not start dating again... :D Honestly, i am not planing to do so in the future. Not only  because i'm pretty heartbroken, but i am actually comfortable with being alone. I don't need a partner to feel complete or worthy. Well.. sometimes guys slide into my dms and it's pretty annoying, but not a big deal, tbh. But yesterday somone actively asked me out! Like, on an actual real-life date including having dinner and sh\*t. The guy is actually pretty nice (not my type, but i know him and he's a good sport), but the thought of dating almost made me throw up! Every part of my body was like: NOO! I felt like if i dated other people it's almost cheating on the person you love, even if you are broken up. (Just to be clear: i know that it's not and that i owe my ex nothing.)

This morning I went to just check on their social media, and just scroll through, and on their Snapchat it said that they were trying to get their ex/a guy to get back together with them and make out, obviously I was furious, even though we've only been together for a week, they still posted that knowing that I'd see it, and that we were dating, I then message them what it was about and what it means and they ignore me, I don't know what to do so I go to my group chat of friends and ask and kinda talk about it with them, then whilst I'm doing that they post another thing on their story its like a tiktok or something and it says ""when your ex messages you and you gotta get rid of your replacement"" that's when I really knew they were ghosting me and were trying to cheat. Whatever so I go and messaged them on their Instagram like five times cause they wouldn't respond, and they finally respond with a ""I'm sorry"" pffftt sure you're sorry, that's so trashy,  then they try to make up excuses like ""some shit came up"" WHAT DO YOU MEAN ""Shit came up"" ? That's such a shit excuse, so shit came up and they tried to cheat on me?? How is that a good excuse?? And then they go into ""well my ex came back in my life and they said they loved me and I still love them back and I just didn't know what to do"" like huh?? Yo you're in a relationship and you don't know how to push away your ex? Bullshit. Than they go into that they thought that not talking to me was a better option because they didn't wanna cause issues and hurt me, I think ghosting is pretty fucking painful ngl, I think a normal breakup would've been a whole lot better then fking ghosting me. So my friends in my group chat kinda just dmed them and told them that they hope their ex ""that's their whole world"" treats them like shit like they did to me, its done whatever, but a couple hour later they then post on their account saying ""hate it when people get too attached to me, I'm a rat babes, I like to ruin your day and come back for a snack"" that's so shitty, they started to flirt with me first and started to get attached to me first, and started to say ""I love you"" first, and I'm the one getting attached?

So my friends in my group chat kinda just dmed them and told them that they hope their ex &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s their whole world&amp;quot; treats them like shit like they did to me, its done whatever, but a couple hour later they then post on their account saying &amp;quot;hate it when people get too attached to me, I&amp;#39;m a rat babes, I like to ruin your day and come back for a snack&amp;quot; that&amp;#39;s so shitty, they started to flirt with me first and started to get attached to me first, and started to say &amp;quot;I love you&amp;quot; first, and I&amp;#39;m the one getting attached? This pisses me off so much, I&amp;#39;ve blocked them and deleted all their photos, I&amp;#39;m so done with long distant relationships, I feel like I always end up getting hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

,BreakUps,"Hi readers, I'm an ordinary boy who met a girl online through a stranger chat app. I met her on 1 May 2017, I still remember the day when I talked with her for first time. She was sweet girl by behaviour, and I liked talking to her that day so much that I asked her for her number. I never saw her before, because it was a stranger app and we connected randomly. 

After requesting a lot for her number, she finally gave it to me. 🙂
We Started talking on whatsapp, for many days. I enjoyed every moment which I spent with her that time.
I was really in love with her character and attitude that time, she was sweet, honest, kind and generous. I believe in loving inner beauty of a girl 😁 

And Few days later, I asked her to become my girlfriend which she denied 😥. She just wanted me as a friend.
I was sad, but I like to spend time with her so I didn't care much.

We were friends for 2.5 years, in these years, she blocked many times, rejected my girlfriend proposals, I used to get hurt a lot 😥, but I never have up.

Finally, on 3 Nov 2019, She accepted me as her boyfriend. That was the happiest day in my life. 
I was so happy, damn! it felt like I was the most happiest man on this earth 🙂🙂🙂 

We talked a lot about many things, used to talk for hours and she was able to talk much because of her work. 😐 But we used to talk for hours till midnight.
And wholeday on Weekends.

We discussed about everything, what we like to eat, wear, our future and everything. 
I never wanted to lie to her or cheat her later, so I told her about my bad habits too, and I also told her that I need lots of se*x after marriage. I just wanted to say the truth to her. 
And she was okay with this too, she accepted those things 🙂😁

And yesterday, she broke up with me 😥, she blocked me and said that we needs Breakup.

Because of the following reason: 
- I'm not of her religion (She's Christian and I'm Hindu)
- we don't have same vision in life
- She needs someone who's mature than her (I'm little childish)

And she Blocked me after that. 💔



I love her a lot, I care for her a lot, in fact my love was never ""love at first site"", I always loved her attitude and her character.
Because I believe that Beauty may shatter, but attitude won't.
I really wanted to marry her, I wanted to support her in everything that she does, I was even happy to cook everyday for her ( Because she doesn't know how to cook), I had lots of dreams and I was ready to do those Because I loved her from my core of the heart.

,BreakUps,"last night I had my first date since the break up. it’s been 6... almost 7 months, but only almost a month of NC. things were just very complicated with my ex. But I had learned how to love him unconditionally, which has made everything following the break up so much harder and confusing. including this date. 

I recently moved back to my college town from my home town and that has made it so much easier to not think about him. I miss him, but I gave him so much time. So it’s about time to move on. I mean, he did get a new girlfriend immediately after we broke up. When we broke up, I told him I wasn’t going to get into a new relationship for a long time, he agreed. obviously he didn’t stick to that, but I still thought that for a long time. I don’t know if I want to be in a relationship or not. But part of me sees him happy with someone new and I want that to be me too. But I know I shouldn’t do it because of that. 

Anyway, back to my date. It was a good one. and I do intend on seeing him again. But I did think of my ex while I was with him. I did compare him to my ex. And I had to avoid some questions he asked because I just straight up didn’t want to mention my ex. It was bad enough I was already thinking of him, I didn’t want to mention him too. The guy is really nice though. I can tell he really likes me. Like almost think fate brought up together. I don’t know though.

&lt;p&gt;I recently moved back to my college town from my home town and that has made it so much easier to not think about him. I miss him, but I gave him so much time. So it’s about time to move on. I mean, he did get a new girlfriend immediately after we broke up. When we broke up, I told him I wasn’t going to get into a new relationship for a long time, he agreed. obviously he didn’t stick to that, but I still thought that for a long time. I don’t know if I want to be in a relationship or not. But part of me sees him happy with someone new and I want that to be me too. But I know I shouldn’t do it because of that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, back to my date. It was a good one. and I do intend on seeing him again. But I did think of my ex while I was with him. I did compare him to my ex. And I had to avoid some questions he asked because I just straight up didn’t want to mention my ex. It was bad enough I was already thinking of him, I didn’t want to mention him too. The guy is really nice though. I can tell he really likes me. Like almost think fate brought up together. I don’t know though. I think I need a little more time with him, but I don’t want to hurt him. and I don’t know if it’s natural to think of my ex when I’m with him. I don’t think I should be doing that.&lt;/p&gt;

,BreakUps,"Hello guys. Imma keep it short and simple.

After 7 months of my first relationship I ended it yesterday, and man it hurts. To be completely honest the last few months have been a really mixed bag. Varying from good moments to absolute shit moments. And the person to blame in most of that is me I believe. Something happened about three months ago that really changed the tides, and even when in reality now I realize it’s not a big deal the damage had been done the minute I found out and acted with vengeance.

Ever since our relationship never really got repaired. We’d have good days but bad weeks. I always fucked up more somehow. I don’t know how she handled me. Anyways, after spending almost 24/7 together for months I recently started to get burnt out of doing the same. Not even her fault, she was as loving and caring as always. I was just too burnt out that anything annoying or inconvenient she did I would freak out and try to lead myself out.

It’s sucks cause now I feel like the breakup is permanent and part of me wishes I wouldn’t have. At the least to give it time and let myself redeem myself, but to do so I’d have to stay in something I don’t think I want to do any longer and in the end is there ever a good time to break up? 

She’s also homeless for the next 7 days as she was staying with me before she moved in to her new place and I’m afraid she won’t be able to find a friend to stay at one of these days. I’ve told her countless times she can stay with me still. Should I keep persisting? also i’d like to help her move in as i was not there when she moved out. in general, i care about her still and know she deserves better. I made her cry the other day because I wanted to go to my friends instead of spend time with her and that broke my heart to see.


Is there anything I can do to repair things? at least as friends? should I keep texting her? I care for her dearly and don’t want anything happening to her.

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any advice on this situation, was it mean to ask for my stuff (games console) back when he&amp;#39;s already quite down? Not sure what to do, or what I can do to help him? He has previously self harmed years before our relationship and had to take off from work due to depression? Has anyone had a similar experience?&lt;/p&gt;

,BreakUps,"Hey, this may be a bit of a stupid special case but I just need to vent. This has been constantly on my mind and at this point, I feel like I just need to say whatever is on my mind. Ignore the username, I made this throwaway ages ago for a completely different issue, with which Reddit was pretty useless.

Over a year ago, I met someone who instantly clicked with me, and I clicked with her. We chatted non stop, and eventually decided we wanted a relationship together. It was long distance, and we knew it would be challenging. But, well, it was too challenging for me. 6 months in, I broke, and I couldn't handle it any more. I broke up with her, and left us both hurting, and yet we still stayed friends because there was no bad blood. But I had things to turn to. I was at university, and I had my friends, and my course, and other general things to keep me distracted. On the other hand, she had nothing. I helped her as much as I could without destroying my mental health. We tried telling ourselves that there were chances in the future, but with the uncertainty of whether I'd want to, we decided maybe it was for the better if we just didn't, to keep us both sane. And so she started healing from it. Now, 9 months after the breakup, she let me know that she's found someone she's interested in (it was a promise to tell each other if this happened), and they're interested in her.

I realise after all this time that while she had been healing, I had just been distracting myself. I didn't need to move on because my life was so busy at the time (another factor in the breakup) that I was too distracted to ever think about it. Now, we're in opposite situations. I'm in the summer break for university, and my days are slow and empty. She's back in education, and spends most of her days with her friends, in her lessons, and with the guy she's found. It took her moving on for me to realise that I never did. Subconsciously, I pretended that she was off the table, and I'd never go back to her because of all the negative sides of our relationship. But subconsciously, I guess I always hung on to the idea that maybe we could try again, once I figured out what I wanted. Obviously, that can't happen now. I know someone might mention that things won't work out between them and maybe some time in the future it'll happen. But A) I absolutely do not want to wish for her newfound potential relationship to fail; before anything I feel, I want her happiness first. And B) That's such unhealthy thinking. If their relationship succeeds to a point of spending their life together, holding on to some kind of hope that there's still a chance would be ridiculously self-harmful.

I fucked up so bad. And the worst part is it's all my fault. Maybe breaking up was the right move. And maybe a future was possible if we worked on ourselves enough. But all this time, I should have been working through my emotions, and I haven't. Now, I find myself in the situation that I put her in 9 months ago. And it sucks. To complain about it is so immensely hypocritical that I hate myself for typing this. She's happy now, living a life that she has wanted for so long, and I'm stuck. We've talked about all of this and like the gem she is, she doesn't want anything to change between us on how close we are. She understands the issues I'm having and while she doesn't know how to stop it hurting other than just letting it be, she's willing to support me if needed. And while I can talk to her about how I didn't move on, and how it hurts, and how despite this I'll do my best and support them, there are some things I wish I could say to her that would be completely unfair. I miss her so fucking much. I wish I could have saved us 9 months ago and I wish I could rekindle it now, but it's not possible. And to be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if she hated me knowing that I think these things. I put her through hell for what I thought was the better cause, and now that it's hurting ME, suddenly I want things back how they were? Now that SHE'S moved on, I'm the one who's stuck in the mud and now I want to turn it into a problem? It's unbelievably selfish, which is why even though I feel like an asshole just for thinking it, I can at least take solace in the fact that I'll never act on it.

I've not had much experience with situations where the best option isn't to try really hard for what you want, to realise that trying will cause more harm, and doing what you don't want to do is the solution. It sucks so fucking much.

I know breakups can bring out thoughts that aren't necessarily true, and that maybe in time, I'll laugh at how wrong I was. But right now, I feel like I realise after 9 months that I'll never find someone better, that I threw away my soulmate.

We stopped doing it as frequently but here and there we would very little and I knew that he would still do so with his friends. A few time he would get angry at me for using without him and in December I had a holiday party at my home and I had gotten some for the both of us to use since it was a party. The party ended with people arguing and over all was a bad experience because everyone was angry and the neighbors had threatened to call the cops. The next day his friend came up to visit and we dropped my ex (lets to call him D.F) off at work and we were going to wait for him to be off. His friend wanted to do cocaine and kept asking for it and I said oh yeah I have some but that I didn’t want to do any without D.F because he would be angry. His friend kept asking for it and asking to see it but I never showed it to him. That same day my housemate and my friend from out of town were going to hang out and we let D.Fs friend tag along since D.F was going to be at work until late. We are celebrating my out of town friends birthday and we start drinking a little and D.Fs friend gets very drunk very quickly and passes out. I drank very little because I was already having a stressful weekend because of the holiday party having left me with problems with neighbors and DF because his OTHER friend had gotten kicked out for being an overall asshole. 

Fast forward later that night I uber DF from work to my friends air bnb where we are hanging out but he is in a very bad mood already. His drunk friend starts going through my purse screaming that he knew it was in my purse because he “himself had put it in my purse” at this point D.F jumps up and starts screaming at me “why is he saying that why is he saying you have some” and I said I didn’t have any (I literally did not it was at my house with my roommate and we were all at D.Fs house like 1:30 in the morning ) and then he and his friend both  started going through my purse looking for it and when he didn’t find it he was still mad and they both started screaming at me that I was a lying bitch and kicked me out.
He broke up with me that same night never again did he ever speak to me with kindness or even acknowledge that I was a an actual person or that we once in love. I have tried to contact him so many time I have tried to talk to him so many times to apologize because in my heart I know that I really do love him. Just a few of the things that he had said to me after that night were :
* Youre a cock sucking whore who probably fucked all my friends behind my back any chance you got 
* I wouldn’t be surprised if you sucked dick for drugs (to which I replied that I had never and he said “you’re right my bad you’re such a whore you probably sucked dick for free and still paid for drugs”)
* D.F said he never loved me and was so embarrassed and ashamed to have ever been with me because all I am is a dirty lying cheating whore
* D.F said I chose drugs over him
* Said that if I wanted to prove that I loved him (he said I clearly didn’t love him because if I did I would have never chosen drugs over him) that I needed to let him cum on my face and that he wanted me to have a threesome with him but to sit there and watch as he would fuck and another girl in front of me and eat her out and that maybe then he would believe that I love him
* D.F said he would never believe that I loved him or that I had never cheated on him because we had never had anal sex and he said that was what he really”desired” all along and that I knew it was his desire and never gave that to him
* He would always ask to rip up my leggings before sex and it never happened because for whatever reason I never found my cheap leggings and I didn’t want him to rip up my 60-120 dollar leggings that I would wear often and alternate (the 120$ ones were a gift)
* D.F I was the absolute worst thing to ever happen to him and that I held him back from “saving even one dollar in 2019” this one hurt a lot because even though I made maybe half what he made I always insisted on paying and gave him gifts out of love and I honestly must have paid for at least 60% of the time just because I wanted to because he is the love of my life and it made me happy to buy him things and pay for him.
* He accused me of cheating with everyone even his friends and housemates
* He said he wouldn’t be surprised if I had sex with the one guy at work who was the most awful disgusting person (this guy used to say that being around me made him want to rape me) because of how disgusting he believes I am too
* Said I never loved him not even a little because I had kept my drug use a secret from him (we had moments where he would scream at me and get really angry and punch walls when we first said we would stop and I would slip)
* I called him so many times crying begging him to please forgive me for hiding the drug use and he wouldn’t listen he would reply to everything I said with “I regret not cumming on your face every chance I got because you were off being a lying whore when I was respecting you by not cumming on your face every chance I got you didn’t deserve my loyalty”
* He said that his biggest regret was ever being with me and being loyal to me and not cheating because he missed out on fucking so many woman and that he was so angry at me for beating the reason why he didn’t get to fuck all those women and that would always be his number regret aside from not cumming on my face every chance he got or fucking me in the ass every chance he got (we tried to do anal but never did because it made me really uncomfortable and it hurt)
* He said he was so ashamed of me and he accused me of having sex with some guy weeks before I even dated D.F and I literally had no reason to lie about that because that was before I ever knew he had feelings for me. When I tried to get that other guy to tell him it wasn’t true D.F got so mad and said he really fucking hates me and that he was mad I had told that guy what D.F was saying because he didn’t want anyone to know he had dated me (everyone knew we were together I didn’t have to tell him but D.F claimed that this other guy knowing we were together proved that I had been cheating with him ALSO because “how else would he know we dated” everyone knew we were basically dating for months before we officially started dating and we didn’t hide it at all so everyone knew.

Hearing the person I live so much say these things to me broke me. I felt that my heart had been shredded to pieces it hurts to wake up and to breathe. I was taken to the hospital 5 times and involuntarily hospitalized 3 times for wanting and trying to kill myself. I would try to talk to D.F when I couldn’t control my suicidal thoughts because then and even now the thought of living without him hurts so much and I wrote him so many goodbye suicide letter but with my failed attempts of suicide I got too scared to try to attempt again and just be locked up again in the hospital. A few times he replied and told em to not kill myself and as soon as I would try to talk to him or say I missed him and just needed to talk he would again start with the nasty cruel sexual remarks as listed above. Every time he says something cruel I can’t stop crying and the only thing that makes me calm myself a little is the thought that one day I will have a successful suicide and won’t have to hurt and hurt over losing him and making him hate me so much over stupid drugs. 


I just want to say if you got this far I never cheated on him and I never would have I love him so fucking much but he thinks I am capable of that because I didn’t tell him about 4-5 times I used drugs with my friends because I was worried that he would get so angry at me but I shouldn’t have thought that way because I knew and everyone knew he was also slipping and using without me and they would all tell me but I never said anything because I knew how hard it was to quit it myself.


I haven’t used anything since then and it has been just about 8 months. It hurts so much I love D.F so much and I wish I had never told him of my suicidal thoughts because he thinks I’m crazy for “being so affected by someone’s words” but those words coming from the love of my life the only person I have ever loved has 100% destroyed and broken me.

I miss D.F so much it hurts to even think about places that we would go to. He said he wants to forget me completely and it hurts so much because he always said he would love me forever and that I would always be in his heart. While he was breaking up with me he was crying and asking why I had to ruin us, why couldn’t I have just been honest because he never fell in love with anyone but he fell in love with me and that I was his dream girl but that I had ruined it all :’(


He replied a few weeks ago to tell me to stop trying to contact him because of how much he hates me. I replied that I am sorry and I feel so much pain and feel like I need to apologize again and again and that I know no matter how much I apologize it will never be enough. He replied to that by saying he doesn’t have the time or care enough to hear anything i have to say because he is on his way to fuck his “current white girlfriend who thinks his dick is amazing and can’t get enough of it” and he also says that he regularly fucks a “40 year old milf pussy who is so much better than me and who does all the things I never did” I don’t know if the 40 year old is the new girlfriend but he also said right after that he and his friend, let’s call him billy “ran a train on a girl the other day” and that he loves how sexy these girls are unlike me whose “face always looked like a retard during sex”. 

As if I wasn’t hurt enough now all I can think of is him with this girl(s) and it kills me. It hurts so fucking bad I have never been treated anywhere remotely as bad as this but I love him so much it HURTS so bad :’(



A week after that I messaged him again that I was thinking of him and saw some shoes I knew he would like and I wanted him to have them but I forgot his shoe size to which he simply replied “14”. 
I mailed him two pairs of shoes, Air Force one and Jordans. I tracked the package to make sure it got there and a few days after it did I tried to ask if it had been received and got no reply to the question other than the usual “fuck off I hate you nasty cheating cocksucking whore”



I LOVE him so much and it hurts so much that I caused him to hate me and that I made him turn so cold and say these horrible things. He broke me and I can’t put myself back together I’ve tried therapy and pretty much everything out there and as soon as I have one second where I think maybe I can be ok all his words come back to me and I want to kill myself to get away from the pain it hurts so much I have never never heard such cruelties in my life I feel so destroyed I don’t feel like a person anymore and I haven’t for this entire year since before last christmas. I love D.F even after everything and I wish I didn’t but I CANT stop loving him I can’t explain it :’(",t2_6zaghkz0,False,,0,False,I feel like I can’t live anymore the pain is too much it hurts so bad this is a long post I’m sorry,[],r/BreakUps,False,6,,0,,False,t3_igh6h4,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598406561.0,text,6,,,text,self.BreakUps,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;if anyone sees this I’m sorry for any typos I tried my best while not being able to stop my crying&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was dating the love of my life and during our time together we started using cocaine a lot and it after a few months we both decided to stop because it was affecting us. We stopped doing it as frequently but here and there we would very little and I knew that he would still do so with his friends. A few time he would get angry at me for using without him and in December I had a holiday party at my home and I had gotten some for the both of us to use since it was a party.

,BreakUps,"So Yesterday was the most tiring day, done a day shift followed by a half night shift, but in the middle I get a text that she isn’t happy in the relationship (3years) and that she isn’t happy in herself and she can’t make me happy when she can’t make herself happy! Fair enough! I’m an understanding person but I hold all emotions in till I can’t no more! Which just makes me experience loads of emotions when I can’t take no more. 😂

But I’ve had this message 3,times and knew every time I received it tripped me up and made me feel like I was the problem, it hurt. I know I’m not the problem and was told by her and my cousin like a sister to me and they are (bestfriends) also! Ffs 🤦🏽‍♂️ 

I’ve had a rough 2020 getting asked to leave her house January, really was a blessing to be honest (still with her parents) but the way they went about it added to the stress in my mental health, then lost my job during covid! During the course I was sleeping on the sofa, still am! Devastated but I’m in a good career to save up. Then obviously lockdown played a part in mental strength to seek a job, I succeeded! Touch! I’m on the up! 

But then I started feeling off in the relationship personal circumstance (late feb)  but I was doing what I could to mend my own feelings! In it! Assume she felt the same! So it was hanging there by a string! For a few months! I think I was scared to letting go of all those memories even though 3 years isn’t long we accomplished a lot! And been through a lot! And we spoke about the future a lot, house, dog, marriage etc both on the same wave length. 

So forward though to yesterday I was staying over her parents as they were abroad for 10nights from last Monday, I started distant, being back where I stayed for 2 1/2 years is hard, just didn’t feel welcoming entering history and normality as so it felt. 

But I started to feel positive day by day and found that connection again, which i never stopped showing to her but inside myself I felt good and not confused! 

yesterday, I sent the usual good morning text and being in such a vibe we had a weekend getaway down south of England this Saturday, buzzing! A Break off work and spend time doing stuff with her. 

That text went out and few hours I get a text back, she’s not happy in our relationship etc I didn’t let it throw me off work! As it’s not the first time I’ve heard it As I’ve built strength to not get down or worry about it during work! 

So I finished early went back to talk, explanation like adults, so she needs time to find herself again and so do I, good terms it ended on, both got lost in the relationship and it fizzled out, could path back together I don’t know, I’m not hoping for it because I’ll never end up moving on that way!!!! But it was raw emotions I felt so I couldn’t process it yesterday, upset defiantly! And today I just couldn’t hold no emotions in It killed me! Gone, let her have space we needed a break, I’m just gutted to dwell on memories on the past. 

finding this forum helped and google, I’m 24 and this is my first break up, and all these emotions are new and adding to the mental stress I’ve been carrying since 16!

,BreakUps,"
A few months after my ex and I broke up I went off the grid. The main reason was for no contact and also because 2020 sucks and I wanted to stay away from the toxicity of the media and stuff.

Recently I brought my Instagram back online, and there was this huge scandal in the UK with the A level students getting downgraded and I got rejected from my universities for medicine. thankfully that situation has been resolved mostly because they changed the way they mark people. The issue now is some people meet the grade requirements but can only join next year. 

Luckily I managed to get a seat in a University for myself to study medicine this year. The rest of the people in my school who take medicine including my ex (who also takes medicine) have been pushed to next year despite meeting grade requirements. 

And just today my ex texted me unexpectedly, on my Instagram. I couldn’t bring myself to tell her that I got into uni, she didn’t get in this year and she’s now talking to me about reapplying next year and going to the same uni. Should I tell her? Idk if telling someone I got into the course they wanted to get into also is a good idea. I’m sad for her ofcourse don’t get me wrong but I just didn’t tell her. 

Regardless I’m taking the offer my university has given me and I’m just afraid she’ll find out I made it in. Idk if should tell her, tbh idek what to do anymore, I’ll be taking my Instagram offline soon but until then I want your advice. What should I do now? Should I continue talking to her?

,BreakUps,"It has been a few days since we said our goodbyes or better parted our ways without even saying one. I am ridden with feelings of guilt, resentment, anger and frustration. My mind keeps reviving the alternative route we or I could have taken to avoid this breakup, but alas I am here.
 What went wrong? I do not exactly know. Who is to blame? While my heart keeps pointing fingers, my brain tells me it was I. I was a match, to light this whole thing on fire, burning it into an abyss. My mind moulded you into some fantasy version, an idea of you. You were perfect and then you were not. I might be unhappy with myself, might have depended on you to offer some happiness but what I never understood is that if I ever asked you to take drastic steps or change to genuinely make me happy?. All I ever asked or suggested you to be considerate. Less communication? You call me just for 2-5 mins on weekend and ask how my week went. Tell me was I ever wrong to want to hear your voice after the week of you being immersed in work?. I did remember you saying we are never too busy for people who are important to us. I do remember doing it for you, back in February standing and catering to 15 or more people in a day while still managing to text and call you. Maybe that is why it hurts. I made you an absolute priority only to be a priority of convenience to you. Someone hit the nail when they said to never expect. So simple and mundane but is it really that simple enough to follow? Guess not for me. I only pray that one day I stop expecting- the bane of my existence because I would not ever stop being considerate.
Yes, I was filled with anger. So what if I expressed it? Did I physically punch you? Anger was not and is not a problem. Anger is natural. Anger is part of life. Yes, I lashed out. Yes, I reacted in the most unattractive and aggressive ways possible when I pointed out the concerns. I raised my voice against you only because I was not ever understood. However we never really got down to the roots as to why that happened, It happened because you failed to acknowledge and act on those. To you, those concerns never really mattered in the bigger schemes of things-“why does it matter? Why do you take this so seriously?”. Oh, I am sorry for giving this relationship importance. I am sorry for thinking it was long-term. I am sorry for not taking this as a relationship of convenience. I am sorry for labelling this as legit relationship while you and I both know it was always friends with benefits disguised under a label of a romantic relationship. Nothing more, nothing else. I am sorry for giving you the end of the stick. While my anger was your fault, to control it, is my responsibility. 
The summer of last year seemed like a blessing, you came into my life sweeping me off my feet- a guy who ticked all the boxes on my checklist or at least the physical ones. The more time we spent together the better I got to know you platonically and unknow you emotionally. I am not sure when and why I fell in love but I just remember holding your hand and realizing how much it was going to hurt when I would have to let you go. That first date ogling at the stars was so promising my female brain couldn’t comprehend how perfect it was. I imagined our future. You could say it even motivated me to confess in you the love I felt for you and at that point, it did not even matter if I was the one to confess first because to me I loved you and I had to get it off my chest. 
You see I was so deprived of love elsewhere in my life that I put this pressure on you- for you to fill those empty pockets in my heart. Now that is a big ask, but I do believe I shall have it if not now albeit later from someone who chooses to love without consequence, motive or barriers. I understand why you chose to keep your guard up all the time after the past relationships and not invest in this relationship as much because I did and look where it got me. Utterly heartbroken. I blame myself. I believed Soulmates do not leave each other. If you were torn between leaving and going- I shall let you go. I do not regret a single moment spent believing you were right for me because I enjoyed the moments before they became memories.
Thank you for the good memories. We crossed paths for a reason. A reason still unbeknownst to myself. Maybe a lesson to not expect. A lesson to make myself a priority. A lesson of how love clouds one’s better judgements. A lesson so bittersweet, bitter right now, bitter in this moment, sweet agony for the future times.
While I appreciate the good times we had as friends, I am afraid we are only compatible platonically. While I have chosen to block you off from every social media platform it is not out of resentment. I genuinely want to see you climb the ladder of success or maybe start a relationship again with somebody. I genuinely want to see you flourish in health and by god I hope and pray that you do. I just do not want to expose myself to those moments right now. Not when my wounds are still fresh, the wounds not necessarily inflicted by you. Not when I go to bed with tears. Not when I wake up feeling a weight has been placed on my chest. Not when I get sudden unpredictable waves of grief. Not till I heal from within, peace imbedded in my being.

,BreakUps,"This morning my girlfriend broke up with me. The doubt has been going on for like 3 months and I have been tyring to make it work. After every problem I would fight for her like there was no tomorrow. But it didn't matter anyway. 

 It started when one of my best friends told my girlfriend that he liked her. I was amazed and confused but let it go because she said it was no problem and she didn't like him. I come from a relationship where I have been cheated on in the past and I find it hard to digest things like that.  It started to feel very strange between my girlfriend and I. There was no more room for hugs, intimacy and or sex. She told me she found it difficult because I made myself look different when he is around. I told her that I found it difficult but that I can best let it go after a while. She quickly agreed to this. But deep in my hearth I knew that there was a lot more going on with her. 

Later I went to that friend to talk it over and it turned out to be nothing special. He respected our relationship and would do his best to leave us alone. With these thoughts things went better for weeks and there was progress between us. But still deep inside me there was a alarm going off like something bad is going to happen. 

But after a while uncertainty began to take over our relationship again. She still thought I was too controlling. I agreed and deleted the ""find your friends"" locations in my iPhone. She accepted this and apologized for her behavior and wanted to work on the relationship immediately. I was happy again, but that turned out to last until this week. She kept saying there was nothing but my feeling said there was a problem, so I kept digging and digging but kept hearing ""nothing's wrong"" so just let it go. Because she would become angry when I tried to help her by asking or guessing whats wrong.

 A few days ago I thought it was getting better and I found peace in myself. This morning I received a message from her that she was not feeling well. I tried to fix this by talking to her but there was nothing to fix anymore. She said that there was no more love and that she was done with our relationship. I was devastated. I didn't understand what I was doing wrong because I thought things were getting better.  One of my friends who also spoke to her told me that she really doesn't want to lose me but that she can't live with me like that because she feels that I don't understand her when she has something. She can't live with me or live without me. 

Right now I don't know what to do. I want her back so badly, but on the other hand, there really needs to be a lot of talking and I don't know if that would help. Also, staying friends won't stay in it for me because she made me feel very alone because when my friends are with us all of the attention goes to her. I become a ghost when I am with them.

,BreakUps,"Very common feeling/thought that makes me sick to my stomach. But, it makes it much easier if you don’t blame yourself and if you know you did everything you could for them. I know, easier said than done. You just have to accept the fact that some people absolutely suck. There is no way to not think about it, time has to run it’s course. But, there are things you can do to speed up that process. 

Get rid of everything of theirs, doesn’t matter how valuable it is or how much you like it. Give them the option to have somebody come get it first, of course. Exhaust every other option before allowing them specifically to come get it. If you have to go that route, make sure there is no face-to-face. If you see them, it’s going to do absolutely no good for either of you. Ask politely if they can have a friend or family member come get it. Don’t be rude &amp; don’t be petty. Give them a heads up, “If you don’t come get your stuff by X, I’m going to throw it out/donate it” and if they don’t come get it, do exactly that. One text, that’s it, there’s NO conversation needed. If they say that they can’t come by that date and try to negotiate or something, you still do not answer. Or simply say “I’m sorry, but that is not my problem”. Their problems are no longer your problems and you’re no longer doing things at their convenience. Start putting yourself first, but still try to be a decent enough person. As I said, don’t be a prick because it helps nobody and you’ll regret it down the road.

Unfollow &amp; block on everything, no exceptions. You can keep their phone number unblocked while you figure out if someone is coming to get their stuff, who gets what, etc. But after that, block their number too. Seeing their tweets, photos, or them texting you isn’t going to help you at all either. Even if they try to see you or want to get back together, they will probably do the same thing again. But if you have their number blocked, you’ll never even get the message! Not to mention, you could be finally starting to get better and one text from them can absolutely crush all of that progress. I suggest keeping it blocked until they pop into your head one day and it doesn’t make you sad. But even when that happens, there is really no point to unblocking. 

Find things to keep you busy. Hang out with friends, find a new hobby, etc. Finding a new hobby can be very useful, pour all of those emotions you’re feeling into it. I recommend trying to learn how to play an instrument, if that interests you. In the beginning, take on the “I’m going to make them regret it” attitude as motivation, and apply it to something. Before you know it, you’ll be doing that thing for you and realize you haven’t thought about them in days/weeks/months. Boom, you’re now a better person in some way, and you’ll feel good about it.

I don’t recommend this one immediately, but hookup with somebody. I would do this once they stop popping in your head when you “do the deed”, if you catch my drift. As I said, this isn’t very ideal for immediately after. Reason one being it’s a rather crappy thing to do and is generally frowned upon. Reason two being your just going to think about them and probably feel worse than you did prior. Doing this right after a breakup is about as useful as a bandaid on a gunshot wound.

This applies to more than I mentioned, by the way. You see something in your place that reminds you of them? Get rid of it or put it out of sight. Their friend posts a picture of them? Block their friend. My advice, do that last one right away, don’t even let that opportunity be there. Also, don’t feel bad for trying to get better and be happy. Also, don’t let anybody make you feel guilty for it.

I went through this, and once I did these things it DRASTICALLY improved how I felt. All this being said, it’s important to not just push down this emotions. You have to confront them and it sucks, but if you don’t it could have lasting effects on your mental health.

But, it makes it much easier if you don’t blame yourself and if you know you did everything you could for them. I know, easier said than done. You just have to accept the fact that some people absolutely suck. There is no way to not think about it, time has to run it’s course. But, there are things you can do to speed up that process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get rid of everything of theirs, doesn’t matter how valuable it is or how much you like it. Give them the option to have somebody come get it first, of course. Exhaust every other option before allowing them specifically to come get it. If you have to go that route, make sure there is no face-to-face. If you see them, it’s going to do absolutely no good for either of you. Ask politely if they can have a friend or family member come get it. Don’t be rude &amp;amp; don’t be petty. Give them a heads up, “If you don’t come get your stuff by X, I’m going to throw it out/donate it” and if they don’t come get it, do exactly that. One text, that’s it, there’s NO conversation needed. If they say that they can’t come by that date and try to negotiate or something, you still do not answer. Or simply say “I’m sorry, but that is not my problem”. Their problems are no longer your problems and you’re no longer doing things at their convenience. Start putting yourself first, but still try to be a decent enough person. As I said, don’t be a prick because it helps nobody and you’ll regret it down the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfollow &amp;amp; block on everything, no exceptions. You can keep their phone number unblocked while you figure out if someone is coming to get their stuff, who gets what, etc. But after that, block their number too. Seeing their tweets, photos, or them texting you isn’t going to help you at all either. Even if they try to see you or want to get back together, they will probably do the same thing again. But if you have their number blocked, you’ll never even get the message! Not to mention, you could be finally starting to get better and one text from them can absolutely crush all of that progress. I suggest keeping it blocked until they pop into your head one day and it doesn’t make you sad. But even when that happens, there is really no point to unblocking. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find things to keep you busy. Hang out with friends, find a new hobby, etc. Finding a new hobby can be very useful, pour all of those emotions you’re feeling into it. I recommend trying to learn how to play an instrument, if that interests you. In the beginning, take on the “I’m going to make them regret it” attitude as motivation, and apply it to something. Before you know it, you’ll be doing that thing for you and realize you haven’t thought about them in days/weeks/months. Boom, you’re now a better person in some way, and you’ll feel good about it.&lt;/p&gt;

The problem that I have with breaking up is that it never seems right? My GF thinks that everything is perfect so no matter what I do it will come out of nothing and I think this will hurt her the most.

If I stop with that she will instantly want to know whats wrong and thats when I would have to break up.

,BreakUps,"7 year break up* My boyfriend (24F) and I (25F) broke up over the weekend after 7 years together. He broke it off but it ended up being mutual. We were in the process of buying a house together but couldn’t go through with it as he felt whilst he could have been happy short term, we may have become unhappy and resented each other and the relationship would have been toxic. I agreed.

We both had a good talk about everything last night and realised we are just not on the same page right now. We are both at different maturity stages in life. We have learned so much about ourselves and bettered ourselves because of each other. It’s incredibly sad as we both love and respect each other very much and have an incredible amount of physical and sexual attraction and chemistry that I wonder if I will ever find with someone else.

After a few days reflection I realise our relationship had become “boring”, we had stopped doing things together and I think we had both just become comfortable to the point where we didn’t feel the need to address it. In retrospect we probably should have communicated this a lot sooner. 

He is in the army so most of the time we are long distance, but we made it work. We were always excited to see each other and he was always committed to spending 5 hour journeys to come back and see me. 

I still have this strong feeling that we could work out one day when we have taken time apart to work on ourselves and see what we really want in life. This might just be my “grieving” talking, but I know that at this moment in time, he needs to do his thing and I need to do mine. Then what will be will be.

,BreakUps,"Bear with me this is gonna be a rollercoaster of a story... enjoy!

so the thing is... that im a muslim and my parents are strict, really strict. I wasn't allowed to go partying late at nights, I had to have good grades, they also controlled my social circle. So i was this above average looking, and a pretty damn charasmatic dude (not to toot my own horn. You know I was the guy who was friends with everyone but didn't had friend (If that makes sense). 

So there comes junior high and I get to meet new people. And I did meet alot of cool people but couldn't be close friends with them because I thought my parents won't like them, and because alot of them were girls. And freinds who are girls don't go hand in hand in muslim culture (at least in my experience).

 And one of those girls was my ex (lets call her olivia cuz its the second most common name). Now at first, i did not have any interest in olivia at all. I just thought that she had a weirdly cool sense of humor. But i knew that she was crushing on me, and when she asked me on a date i agreed (before olivia i had no past relationship or any experience with girls. I thought i should give it a shot. We went to second base at the end of the date. And I shot my shot a week later and asked her to be my girlfriend, to which she immediately said yes (btw I asked her on snapchat). 

Oh did I forget about my strict muslim parents with the no-girlfriend rule especially if she's German? yes, I did forgot about that for a moment, and at that very moment is the shitshow started. 

Months went by and I kept my relationship a secret from my parents, I saw my ex once a week if i was lucky ( I mean if she was lucky, we both had it tough). and about six months and one break-up (which I initiated) later, I broke up with her again, but I came back and told her that I've decided to tell my parents that we are in a relationship and that Ill fight for her. I did what i told her. 

And for the next six months my relationship was normal (well almost). But my relationship with my parents just hit rock bottom every frickin day was a mess. I was psychologically fucked up. My grades went down (they weren't terrible but just not good enough). So my only escape was my ex. I was afraid that im obsessing over her, and i didn't want to lose her because of being needy. So I spent a little bit more of my time with friends (most of which who are girls) and we fought a couple of time because she LITERALLY believed that giving her enough attention. 

she started acting reallz passive aggressive, like telling me that im a Zero in bed in comparision to a one-night stantd she heard her friend talk about (REALLY??). Or spending a night with a mutual guy friend of ours and telling me about it the next day. Or talking about other guys infront of me (which ironically didn't bother me because im bi-sexual). But I knew what she was up to. So I really tried my best with being attentive and not obssesive. 

And there come quarantine. Remember when I said that my parents are strict muslims and remember when I said im a guy. Now, imagine strict muslim parents and a daughter. Yea, I have a sister who had enough of their shit and ran away out of the blue during quarantine. My dad also suffered a heart attack during that time because of the stress of a runaway daughter. I had alo on my shoulders. A runaway sister, a sick father in the hospital bed, and a full fed up mother. And also a \*under appreciated\* girlfriend.

Well Olivia broke up with my in may saying that we aren't compatible and became distant. She did't feel that warmth anymore so she decided to end it. I told her that I still love her and im willing to work for it. But she wasn't. 2 weeks later I called her back to ask her how she was, becuase 7 years ago at that day her mother died of cancer. we also talked about the relationship saying that she doesn't see us together anymore. She said that she would like to be friends, which i declined by saying i would like to end our relationship as a pair and that i wouldn't like to hear from her ever again. 

Well after that I decided to move on, and I had that move on mindset. During the last three months all I did was hit the gym super hard and look after myself (I became really shredded again) partying drinking and stuff. My parents aren't that strict anymore. They say to to get over someone you need to get under someone else, well I made out with one girl but nothing more. I haven't started dating anybody. 

Its been a week since the final year of school has started and whenever I see her I get sad and over-emotional. prettz early into the break up whenever we saw eachother we exchanged smiles, but now she dosen't even look at me. I mean I try to avoid her too, but it still hurts. I believe that I haven't done much after the breakup and sometimes I feel like a total loser. 

I know I wrote alot but, It would be really helpful If you guys could help me out.

TL;DR : She broke up with me because I wasn't very attentive and now I can't get over her.",t2_5z2nhfvd,False,,0,False,Its been three months and I (M 20) still can't get over my ex girlfriend (F 19) and my weird relationship.,[],r/BreakUps,False,6,,0,,False,t3_igcf4y,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1598391715.0,text,6,,,text,self.BreakUps,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bear with me this is gonna be a rollercoaster of a story... enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so the thing is... that im a muslim and my parents are strict, really strict. I wasn&amp;#39;t allowed to go partying late at nights, I had to have good grades, they also controlled my social circle. So i was this above average looking, and a pretty damn charasmatic dude (not to toot my own horn. You know I was the guy who was friends with everyone but didn&amp;#39;t had friend (If that makes sense). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there comes junior high and I get to meet new people. And I did meet alot of cool people but couldn&amp;#39;t be close friends with them because I thought my parents won&amp;#39;t like them, and because alot of them were girls. And freinds who are girls don&amp;#39;t go hand in hand in muslim culture (at least in my experience).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one of those girls was my ex (lets call her olivia cuz its the second most common name). Now at first, i did not have any interest in olivia at all. I just thought that she had a weirdly cool sense of humor. But i knew that she was crushing on me, and when she asked me on a date i agreed (before olivia i had no past relationship or any experience with girls. I thought i should give it a shot. We went to second base at the end of the date. And I shot my shot a week later and asked her to be my girlfriend, to which she immediately said yes (btw I asked her on snapchat). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh did I forget about my strict muslim parents with the no-girlfriend rule especially if she&amp;#39;s German? yes, I did forgot about that for a moment, and at that very moment is the shitshow started. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Months went by and I kept my relationship a secret from my parents, I saw my ex once a week if i was lucky ( I mean if she was lucky, we both had it tough). and about six months and one break-up (which I initiated) later, I broke up with her again, but I came back and told her that I&amp;#39;ve decided to tell my parents that we are in a relationship and that Ill fight for her. I did what i told her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for the next six months my relationship was normal (well almost). But my relationship with my parents just hit rock bottom every frickin day was a mess. I was psychologically fucked up. My grades went down (they weren&amp;#39;t terrible but just not good enough). So my only escape was my ex. I was afraid that im obsessing over her, and i didn&amp;#39;t want to lose her because of being needy. So I spent a little bit more of my time with friends (most of which who are girls) and we fought a couple of time because she LITERALLY believed that giving her enough attention. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;she started acting reallz passive aggressive, like telling me that im a Zero in bed in comparision to a one-night stantd she heard her friend talk about (REALLY??). Or spending a night with a mutual guy friend of ours and telling me about it the next day. Or talking about other guys infront of me (which ironically didn&amp;#39;t bother me because im bi-sexual). But I knew what she was up to. So I really tried my best with being attentive and not obssesive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there come quarantine. Remember when I said that my parents are strict muslims and remember when I said im a guy. Now, imagine strict muslim parents and a daughter. Yea, I have a sister who had enough of their shit and ran away out of the blue during quarantine. My dad also suffered a heart attack during that time because of the stress of a runaway daughter. I had alo on my shoulders. A runaway sister, a sick father in the hospital bed, and a full fed up mother. And also a *under appreciated* girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well Olivia broke up with my in may saying that we aren&amp;#39;t compatible and became distant. She did&amp;#39;t feel that warmth anymore so she decided to end it. I told her that I still love her and im willing to work for it. But she wasn&amp;#39;t. 2 weeks later I called her back to ask her how she was, becuase 7 years ago at that day her mother died of cancer. we also talked about the relationship saying that she doesn&amp;#39;t see us together anymore. She said that she would like to be friends, which i declined by saying i would like to end our relationship as a pair and that i wouldn&amp;#39;t like to hear from her ever again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well after that I decided to move on, and I had that move on mindset. During the last three months all I did was hit the gym super hard and look after myself (I became really shredded again) partying drinking and stuff. My parents aren&amp;#39;t that strict anymore. They say to to get over someone you need to get under someone else, well I made out with one girl but nothing more. I haven&amp;#39;t started dating anybody. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its been a week since the final year of school has started and whenever I see her I get sad and over-emotional. prettz early into the break up whenever we saw eachother we exchanged smiles, but now she dosen&amp;#39;t even look at me.

,BreakUps,"I (m22) have spent ages going over every detail of why happened when my gf (f20) of 5 years broke up with me by text. I know many people will say “there must have been signs” or “something must have been wrong” but when I say it doesn’t make sense I really mean that. 

I’ve re read all my text messages to her, went over dates, photos, thought about everything we spoke about, and there’s nothing. Everything was great, Atleast it looked that way. We had been doing loads, had loads planned for the future, no arguments or issued happened. Just 5 days before the break up she sent a message that literally said stuff like “we’re so strong together” and “we don’t ever have to worry about breaking up”. If someone is sending you these messages then how can you even have a clue that a break up is less than a week away. 

I asked her what happened and all she says is she’s “confused” or “that it’s hard to explain”. Well I was with you for 5 years, it would be nice if you tried to explain!!! I literally don’t have a clue what happened, what I did wrong. Everything seemed great, she seemed happy, this is all so confusing.

&lt;p&gt;I’ve re read all my text messages to her, went over dates, photos, thought about everything we spoke about, and there’s nothing. Everything was great, Atleast it looked that way. We had been doing loads, had loads planned for the future, no arguments or issued happened. Just 5 days before the break up she sent a message that literally said stuff like “we’re so strong together” and “we don’t ever have to worry about breaking up”. If someone is sending you these messages then how can you even have a clue that a break up is less than a week away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked her what happened and all she says is she’s “confused” or “that it’s hard to explain”. Well I was with you for 5 years, it would be nice if you tried to explain!!! I literally don’t have a clue what happened, what I did wrong. Everything seemed great, she seemed happy, this is all so confusing. &lt;/p&gt;

,BreakUps,"This is to anyone who is going through a break up. 

Wether it was yesterday, two weeks ago or a year. 

You’re going to feel pain, you’re going to want to contact them and do say and do all the things you wish you had when you were together.

Just stop for a second. Let yourself feel those feelings. Take it all in, cry it out. Repeat. It’s going to sometimes feel like it’s all over and you’ll never love again.

I was there two weeks ago. I thought she was the one, we broke up and I initially was ok. Three weeks later I was beside myself, full of regret and miserable. 

How could I have let her slip away, why did I not stop it, why didn’t I give her more during the relationship, why didn’t I make her a priority, why didn’t I do more interesting dates, why didn’t I surprise her often. All the why’s, all the what if’s. 

I sat there watching a sad movie and I realised, because she’s not my person. We were on different paths, not right for eachother.

The brain has a funny way of protecting you from bad memories and projecting only the positive. Our minds are wired to only remember the parts that we want to in an attempt to service that little bit of dopamine we get when imagining ourselves back with them.

We’re all addicts, addicted to the drug that is love, affection and intimacy. 

But this isn’t about getting back together. 

This is about you. I let myself feel that pain, I decided to fully heal I needed to be fully broken. Did I stalk her insta? Yes. It punished me, I imagined her with another guy, doing everything we did together intimately. Did it hurt, fuck yes. But you know what. It made me stronger, It made me heal. 

Then one day. I woke up and I felt a little better. Then the next, a little better again. I started eating better, I started working out again, cold days felt nice, my favourite meal made me excited. 

It gets better. They say time heals all wounds, but for that to happen you need to accept you have a wound and care for it. 

So this is a sign, for those of you looking. Face your worst nightmare, then look at yourself in the mirror and say ‘I’ve fucking got this, look at me. There is someone waiting for me to come into their life and I’m going to be bloody ready.’

,BreakUps,"My girlfriend of 6 years broke up with me in March. I was devastated-- we had started dating when we were high schoolers and had made it long-distance in college. It was truly blindsiding. After 3 months of no contact, I was in a great place. I embarked on a solo cross country trip-- a month and a half on the road living out of my car, hiking in a dozen National Parks and just being free to live as myself. 

Halfway through the trip, we began talking again. She revealed she regretted everything and still loved me. We agreed to try again when I got back home. Things fell apart before we could reunite. She realized that she had some feelings for someone she met in the last month of us dating, and even though she doesn't want to escalate her friendship with him, her feelings were enough for her to realize she couldn't commit to me. She told me all of this 3 days ago.

I'm sad and angry, but it's different this time. I'm able to see a future without her. For the first time in my adult life, no part of my identity is tied to another person. I'm capable of awesome experiences-- I can go on inspiring trips and be self-sufficient. I'm healthy-- physically and mentally. Things aren't perfect, but there's hope for a future that doesn't involve her.

I sent her a long message, asking her to give me space. It was blunt, perhaps even mean. I said she has reasons to be ashamed-- dragging out this breakup, giving false hope, and failing to catch herself as she developed feelings for someone else while we dated. She was naive, not malicious, but it still hurt me. My anger will soften with time, and I will forgive her and value this experience as a life lesson. But for now, I will feel how I feel. 

Beware reconciliation. It's not sunshine and rainbows. I'm sure it can work, but it involves opening yourself up to fresh hurt.

,BreakUps,"Writing this to remind myself and hopefully help someone through the pain.

I told him I forgave him for the breakup and then found out he lied to me about the reason he wanted to break up and told the actual reason to our mutual friend. In short, he said he didn't want me to think any of it was my fault and he was feeling overwhelmed by us lately (which I thought was because distance was too painful for him) but I was amazing. He told our mutual friend that I smothered him (which he never told me was a problem and this would've been our first problem if he actually told me. We only had minor things come up beforehand which we both apologized to each other for). I felt insanely betrayed especially since I never talked bad about him to anyone even after the breakup and was always honest with him and kept our relationship private except for a few times I said good things about him to friends. The only reason I even told the mutual friend about the breakup is because he asked how we were doing.

&lt;p&gt;I told him I forgave him for the breakup and then found out he lied to me about the reason he wanted to break up and told the actual reason to our mutual friend. In short, he said he didn&amp;#39;t want me to think any of it was my fault and he was feeling overwhelmed by us lately (which I thought was because distance was too painful for him) but I was amazing. He told our mutual friend that I smothered him (which he never told me was a problem and this would&amp;#39;ve been our first problem if he actually told me. We only had minor things come up beforehand which we both apologized to each other for). I felt insanely betrayed especially since I never talked bad about him to anyone even after the breakup and was always honest with him and kept our relationship private except for a few times I said good things about him to friends. The only reason I even told the mutual friend about the breakup is because he asked how we were doing.&lt;/p&gt;

A couple of months down the line she admitted that she liked me and though I was not looking for a relationship,I was fine with being ""more than friends"",mind you I ""liked"" this girl and was not in love with her.

Fast forward a year and I really hit it off with another girl in class and I truly thought I could hit it off with her,so I told my ""more than friend"" that our thing had to end.

However,things didn't work out with this new girl either and once again I seemed to go through this ""hearbreak"". History repeated itself and I was back to my ""more than friend""

However,this time my opinion on her changed! I genuinely felt like I was falling in love with her and in fact for the first time in my life I had a sense of stability

A couple of months back we just completed a year and a half of our relationship and she told me that she doesn't have feelings for me anymore

I've been super sad ever since and honestly there are days where I just wake up in the morning and start crying because I can see her in my head

We've spoken on and off and our conversations have been great,I recently asked her if she felt anything toward me and she said that she doesn't and that shattered my heart into a thousand pieces

First time I broke up with him due to one of many fights where he would call me a victim for struggling with my anxiety disorder and his anger has broken me down. All I think about is the good memories, before his anger got the best of him. Not sure where to go from here, I just want him back, but I know I have to stand up for myself.

Let me preface this by saying that I was the one who left the relationship. I (26F) was in an almost 8-year relationship with my partner (27M). This year was one of our roughest years, but we still had problems leading up to this. What broke me, was our last fight. It was a fight that we had had a couple times, but each one just kept tearing me down piece by piece. I felt like I was losing myself-- in that, I was becoming a shell of a person. I was recently diagnosed with GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) and I had been really relieved to get the diagnosis, because I've always been on edge, anxious and just generally panicky for the most part. The anxiety debilitated me and the quarantines have fueled it, to the point that I had a hard time driving, I avoided the freeways like the plague, I would fear having panic attacks just by existing. My anxiety grew throughout the years, because I believe that I was always living alone and away from my partner. He never committed to moving in with me, when he would visit, he would leave immediately in the morning. We were long distance, but only lived 15-20 minutes apart. He didn't have a car, so I'd usually make the drive and visit him for the most part, but recently I'd been asking him to ask his parents if he could use the car or take public transportation, which he obliged to.

Anyways, our last fight was very toxic and brutal. One of my friends (that I'm trying to be closer to) invited me to a Netflix girlfriend date (just watching some KDRAMA) and she canceled the last time, and we never re-scheduled. She messaged me a few days ago and thought we were doing it on that day, but I wasn't prepared and being an anxious person and someone who likes to plan, I just told her that I didn't know we were planning on doing it today and asked to properly schedule it. My boyfriend did not like that and pushed me to just be spontaneous and hang out with her. I tried explaining to him that I'm just not feeling well (PMS week) and I wish we would have actually planned it, instead of just assuming it was going to be whenever-- but he wasn't hearing any of it. He said that I wasn't spontaneous and implied that I was holding myself back (I agree) by not just hanging out with my friend and that I was, once again, being a victim. I hate that word so much.

Just the past few years, he started calling me a victim. This was when my anxiety and mental health started getting really bad, to the point that I couldn't sleep or even drive to the grocery store. He started yelling at me as I started giving him my excuses, and I just broke down crying-- feeling helpless and just wishing that I wasn't like this, that I could become what he wanted me to be, spontaneous and anxiety-free. I had cried in the car a few weeks prior, apologizing to him about how hard it must be to be with me.

I want to make clear, I don't consider myself a victim. I have at least that much self-respect. When he calls me a victim, I just black out and start crying. Like I can't believe that someone that I've loved for so long would just yell at me while I'm crying my eyes out and tell me to stop crying and that I'm a victim and I should get over it. He knew I was a few weeks into therapy and I was really trying to get my life together, but he kept yelling at me-- I couldn't get a word in, I just tried to speak calmly, but all I could do is ugly cry. At the end of it, I told him that I couldn't do it anymore-- I couldn't be in this relationship anymore. He wasn't understanding how hard it was for me, he was lacking the empathy that I always wanted from him and he was resorting back to his anger (which we agreed that he would seek therapy for when we got back together after he broke up with me for the 2nd time and never did..) This was the first time I initiated a break up, because I really don't just say these things just out of anger, it was something I was thinking for a long time.

His demeanor completely changed, and he begged me to give him a break, a one-month break. But we had already tried going on a break, it wasn't changing anything because he knew he was going to get me back at the end of the break. When we got together and agreed to seek therapy individually, he put it off for about two months, I got a therapist within a few weeks. We have the same insurance, but apparently they got his birth date wrong, so the insurance wasn't processing right, so he needed to fix it and he never did. He kept putting it off and procrastination is something that he has been struggling with for a long time, for our entire relationship.

He was just so shocked that I would break up with him, but I told him that I absolutely hated the arguments we would get in where he would yell at me and call me a victim and I'd just be sitting there crying. He told me that he didn't know why he just snapped at me and to give him a break to fix himself, but I already gave him almost 8 years to fix this, how is this going to make a difference?

I was tired of waiting for him to move out of his parents house, I was tired waiting for him to start searching for a job, so we can start the next chapter of our lives. I was tired of now being yelled at for being weak. I just wanted him to support and comfort me as I worked through therapy, but I'm too much for him, apparently. Walking away from him is not easy. I may have stayed a few more years if his anger wasn't an issue, but being yelled at like that is just so soul-crushing. I had to be honest with myself and I just told him it was over. I told him exactly what I needed from him and he put it off for so many years and months and that it was over.

I miss him so much, this was the man I was going to build my life with. I grew up with him and got to know his family and he got to know mine. We went through some of the hardest times together and made it out alive because we supported each other. Somewhere down the line, our personalities changed, whether it be I got too sensitive, or he got too firm. I moved up here about 6 years ago to be with him, to start college and be closer. I graduated college and got a job that pays the bills, but he sat comfortably in our relationship and I feel like since I've been nagging him more to get a job, it's gotten to him and he isn't ready to take the next step-- but I was, I've been waiting for so long!

The worst part of it all is just remembering the beautiful memories we created together, the ones where he truly showed me what a kind and gentle person and it makes me feel like I did something wrong to turn him into someone that would belittle someone for struggling with mental illness. I blame myself, honestly and truly. What did I do to push him into becoming this way? Was I really that bad? I don't know.

All he can tell me is that he's been super anxious trying to plan his life without me and he really wants to get his life together and misses me and that this whole situation has just been so abrupt-- but I saw it a mile away, if he kept up with his anger.

Part of it is kind of familiar, heck, I've been living by myself-- with strangers from Craigslist or college for a while now. I've learned to be independent, but it's come at a cost, I have really bad mental health days and all I wanted was his support, but I was patient for it.

I don't know what to do except trying to distract myself and keep my anxiety down as best as I can. I want to laugh with him again and play video games and I know he does too, but if he yells at me again or belittles my mental health, I'll just lose it again, I can't do that again. I know he's a good guy, everyone knows that he can get his shit together, everyone, but himself! He's the only one holding himself back, I just thought he would love himself, or me, enough to want the best for himself.

As i have already posted a couple of times here, some may know the story some might not. 
So my ex broke up with me 4 months ago and was constantly nagging me to be friends with her. She had been through an abusive relationship, so yeah i did have sympathy for her. 

Tried being friends with her , turned out to be an absolute horrible idea as just her talking to me and telling how happy she is and everything in life is going good, makes me feel i could never make her happy. So realized it late but it's definitely a bad idea to remain friends with your ex. Trust me , it even degrades the friendship as i used to get angry at her at regular intervals remember she dumped me for someone else . 

Told her several times to leave me alone, but she won't listen. Why don't people understand if you have broken up have the guts to forget that person. Why bind him/her in a chain of friendship. This is terrible idea, i mean when she told me about all the guys flirting with her and how she has crushes now makes my anger level go up. I guess that's normal.

So , yesterday she again texted me and pretty fast it turned into a conversation and i just had enough of it. Called her up and told her not to contact me again in a rude way i must say , i told her different things to since i was angry at her for not leaving me alone. Did i do too much? Should i have stayed easy on her and just ignored her calls and text? Does insulting your ex who dumped you makes me a bad person?

She contacted me one day and came over. She asked for space but still wanted to be with me. She told me she feels overwhelmed. She feels that like she is struggling to communicate with me because she is too scared to tell me.

A few days go by and she messages me a few times.

Then I message her telling her that I want this relationship over. I told her this isn't a relationship if she wasn't able to be open and honest with me and to hold it back and bring it up when she gets overwhelmed. She didn't try to fight for it.

I asked her if she still wanted me in her life. And she replied "" I don't know"" so I just m ended it and said we are done. I want a relationship where someone wants me in their life and is willing to work through things

I told her I wish her all the best in life. I told her I wish she can find her happiness with or without me and she deserves the best.
